The Western aesthetic (also known as the Wild West) is a popular genre inspired by the lives of early settlers of the American Frontier. The Western aesthetic entails themes of self-reliance, solitude, and wildness. Western folklore often includes tales of lone vigilantes travelling the American Frontier on horseback, more times than not armed with a six-shooter revolver or a rifle and prepared to dole out justice. Visually, the Western aesthetic shares many similarities to that of Country, but places an emhasis on imagery of the historical Wild West, as well as the motifs of vigilantism and adventure commonly depicted in popular Western films. While the Country aesthetic romanticizes the life of family, farming, and living in the countryside, Western focuses more on the idea of the wilderness, specifically the desert and prairie, as well as wandering town to lawless town dotted accross the American Frontier.  A Space Western, alternatively called Space Cowboy, is a subgenre of the Western aesthetic that applies the themes of the American Frontier to outer space, or the "Final Frontier." This theme has been explored in different media such as the anime Cowboy Bebop (1998) and film John Carter (2012).Another subgenre of the Wild West is the Weird West, which mixes the Western style with horror or mystery. Quentin Tarantino's 2015 film The Hateful Eight combines the Western film genre with Murder Mystery.
