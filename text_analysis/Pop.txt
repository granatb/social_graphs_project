Pop, also known as popular, is a music genre that originally emerged in the mid-50s in the USA and the UK. Up until the 60s, the meaning also included rock 'n roll, but afterward came a proper definition and musical consolidation. It derived from folk, rock, and traditional Western popular music, which followed the canons of "The Great American Songbook". Pop is generally quite fluid and its' main focus is the appeal to the major audience. Nowadays, it often interlocks with other genres, such as R&B, urban, dance, Latin, country, and electro.
