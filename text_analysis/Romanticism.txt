Romanticism was an artistic, literary, musical and intellectual movement that originated in Europe toward the end of the 18th century, and in most areas was at its peak in the approximate period from 1800 to 1850. The movement developed in reaction against the rationalism of the Enlightenment, and later on, against the materialism of the Industrial Revolution.Romanticism, at its heart, values: nature, emotionality, subjectivity, and individuality. But above all, the Romantic strives towards the enigmatic ideal of the "sublime". Because Romanticism is so idealistic, it often aligns itself with Nationalism which is why the traits and visual tropes of Romanticism vary from country to country. However, this fascination with national ideals often resulted in a Romantic fertilization of non-western/European societies and cultures.
