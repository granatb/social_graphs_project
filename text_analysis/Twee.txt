The term 'Twee', defined as a British term meaning "affectedly or excessively dainty, delicate, cute, or quaint", is the baby-talk mispronunciation of sweet and is seen in the lexicon as early as 1905. Though the term became derogatory, it was reclaimed by the indie pop music scene in the UK and US.
