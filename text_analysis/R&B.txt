R&B, also known as Rhythm and Blues, is a music genre that combines elements of pop, soul, funk, hip hop and electronic music. The genre features a distinctive record production style, drum machine-backed rhythms, pitch corrected vocals, and a smooth, lush style of vocal arrangement. This aesthetic is a more chill, relaxed, and laid-back sub-aesthetic/sub-genre of Baddie.
