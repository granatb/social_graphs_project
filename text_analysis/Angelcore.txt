Angelcore is a contemporary aesthetic inspired by imagery and depictions of angels, and is adjacent to devilcore. The aesthetic is designed to emulate the same unearthly beauty that European angels are described and depicted with, though it can also include non-European angel aesthetics. This can be done with modern or older presentation methods. The Angelcore aesthetic is not always explicitly religious and sometimes involves sacrilege. Users of these aesthetic are not necessarily religious.
