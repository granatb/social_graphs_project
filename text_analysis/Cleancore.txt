Cleancore (also known as Safetycore or Safetygoth) refers to an aesthetic based around clean objects or objects intended to sanitize, such as soaps, sponges, and bathtubs, as well as places that may seem to have been recently cleaned. It can be divided into two subaesthetics, each of which looks vastly different - High Cleancore deals with the adult world and products aimed at adults, such as washed-out soaps and sterile hotel rooms, while Low Cleancore deals with products aimed at children, such as bath toys and rubber ducks.As a continuation of many of its predecessors, Cleancore cynically embraces capitalist imagery. Yet at the same time, taps into its anxiety-stricken audience, becoming a particularly popular aesthetic to try and achieve during the COVID-19 pandemic.
