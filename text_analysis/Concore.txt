Concore is an aesthetic associated with thieves, conmen, grifters, lifters, and scammers. The prefix comes from the word con, which is short for “confidence trick.” The core element of a con is convincing people that someone or something is other what it is in reality and is usually done for monetary gain. Concore aesthetics frequently appear in espionage, crime, and detective media.Concore experienced revival beginning in the 2010s, with social media influencers using photography tricks and editing software like Photoshop to appear thinner and healthier in an effort to earn commission on untested products.
