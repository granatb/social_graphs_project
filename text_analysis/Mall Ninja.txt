Mall Ninja is a set of stereotypes about men who claim to be badass and have an interest in weapons, anime, and action movies. Despite their claim of being well-versed in weaponry, in reality they do not actually practice or seek expert guidance. In addition, they often make threats and claims to their fighting prowess and may actually have some experience, but they have an over-theatrical nature, enthusiasm for violence, and an inability to grasp the reality of fighting that make them off-putting. The main aesthetic concept of the Mall Ninja aesthetic is being a poor mimicry of fictional badass characters. Their weapons, which they often carry in the eponymous malls, tend to be tacky and based on items that they have seen in anime. For example, they would have unnecessary ornamentation like colors, have no practical function, and are made of poor quality materials. Likewise, the clothing that they would wear is cheap, may fit poorly, and looks tacky. This is not based on purposeful camp, but rather being inexperienced in judging quality. Most of the aesthetics and hobbies also overlap with Weeaboos. In fact, one of the main motivators of becoming a mall ninja could come from wanting to be like an anime character or because of the Dunning-Kreuger Effect; a Weeaboo may mistake the hours of anime they watched as weapons training. These two groups also share similar stereotypes of a lack of hygiene, anti-social personality, basement-dwelling, and over-obsession with their hobbies.
