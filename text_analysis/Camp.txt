As described by Susan Sontag, the academic who codified the term, its characteristics are: "artifice, frivolity, na√Øve middle-class pretentiousness, and shocking excess". It is utilized in multiple mediums including film, fashion, theatre, music, and even modes of speech. The aesthetic concept is popular within the gay community because of gay men being perceived by mainstream society as less masculine and worthy of ostracization. Camp becomes a way for them to exaggerate the effeminate and taboo parts of themselves as a rebellion against what society perceives a man should be, and the culture's behavior and camp inform each other. For example, drag shows, the gay "accent," and cult films popular within the LGBT community such as The Rocky Horror Picture Show are examples of camp.Defined by Merriam Webster: "Absurdly exaggerated, artificial, or affected in a usually humorous way." This Definition gives the "Campy" aesthetic an incredibly wide reach, while still fitting within the genre. While many things can and do fall within this definition, there are some that are deeply associated with "camp".
