Peach is an aesthetic that revolves around things that are considered peachy, the fruit of the same name or the colour. The aesthetic is similar to Softie, but, unlike it, doesn't have a wide variety of possible colour palettes and focuses on peaches instead of gentleness. It falls into two categories: Modern Peach, which refers to the present by using more minimalist and simplified forms, often with a combination of pink and white, and Vintage Peach, which is associated with the past, pays great attention to nostalgia and appreciation of various art forms of the time, especially to the music and the fancy looks.
