Thank you.Stripcore is an aesthetic inspired by a romanticized vision of strip clubs and other such establishments. It is based around the idea of strip clubs and glow in the dark undergarments. The aesthetic glorifies the neon signage and back alley advertisements, as well as the glamorous interiors of these sorts of establishments.This aesthetic is often associated with a wide variety of musical styles, but in the modern era, Rap, R&B, Hip-Hop and Trap are most commonly associated with this aesthetic.  Because of the color palettes and similar motifs, Stripcore shares a lot in common with Synthwave, Vaporwave, and Glowwave, but with more of an adult spin than some of the aesthetics already feature.
