Cyberdelic (now known as Virtualcore) is a term used to the immersion in cyberspace as a psychedelic experience. The fusion of cyberculture and the psychedelic subculture into a new counterculture of the 1980s and 1990s.  Its chief spokesperson, Timothy Leary, was a popular figure in the Hippie counterculture movement due to his strong endorsement of utilizing psychedelic drugs (specifically LSD), and then got on board with the Cyberdelic movement to push virtual reality (as well as the utilization of "smart drugs") as the wave of the future to create a potential futuristic utopia in place of psychedelics.  While the Cyberdelic movement faded after the dot.com bubble burst in 2000, it has since gained ground again in the modern era as a form of escapism from the increasingly-dystopic reality that we currently face.Much like the Hippies and Psychedelica, Cyberdelic is consistently linked with the Cyberpunk aesthetic of the 80's, though it should be noted the two are separate aesthetics in their own right.
