1950s Suburbia describes the culture of the American middle class in the 1950s. Due to a population boom following World War Two, new neighborhoods were built in the areas surrounding large cities. These communities were known as suburbs, thus the term suburbia. The most famous example is Levittown, in New York state, which was the prototype for mass produced, mass-scale housing.The government led push for a return to normalcy (i.e., traditional gender roles) following World War Two, created an idealized image of the American family and the United States itself. The ideal suburban neighborhood was a friendly community, where everyone looked and thought exactly the same way, and everyone was happy. This image was reflected in advertising, books, and television shows.1950s Suburbia imagery was used in the horror genre as early as 1959 (in The Twilight Zone) to indicate the uncanny or surreal. Today, the intensely gendered and socially regimented lives of the middle class of the time are a source of fear to an audience that lives in a post-second wave feminist world. See Suburban Gothic for more details.Women's fashion and gender expectations from this time period heavily influenced the Tradwife movement.
