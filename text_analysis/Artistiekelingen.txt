Artistiekelingen (or Pleiners) was a subculture of young people that existed in the 1950s. It mainly consisted of artistic and philosophical young adults. They were known for listening to jazz music, wore dark clothing, and were interested in French culture and literature. The main pastimes of the Pleiners were to hang out in the street, discuss art and literature, and visit underground jazz clubs. In terms of style, they usually wore dark, irreverent clothes. Males often wore their hair combed forward while women kept their hair either very long or very short. The males occasionally smoked a pipes. Together with the nozems, they were the first true youth culture in the Netherlands.
