Internet Academia is an aesthetic based around learning through the internet. It is also based off Chaotic Academia, Art Academia, and Dark Academia. Internet Academia mostly started with the COVID-19 pandemic, causing students all around the world to stay at home and study/work from there. Despite this, Internet Academia can also refer to using the internet for studies and in classes pre-pandemic. This can involve doing research, making presentations, writing papers, and using e-books.
