Gamine refers to a girl who appears to be youthful, regardless of age. They are someone who have a boy-ish beauty and can comfortably wear boys' clothing (that is, they look comfortable in the clothing, and do not look like a female trapped in boys' clothing). Overall, the gamine style is cute and boyish.
