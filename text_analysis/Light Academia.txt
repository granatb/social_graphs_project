Light Academia is an academic aesthetic and the visually lighter counterpart of Dark Academia.  Dark Academia typically involves intense and negative themes, including literary tragedy, discussion of the meaning of life, heartbreak, oppression, escapism, and death. In contrast, Light Academiaâ€™s themes are generally positive, focusing on optimism, sensitivity, joy, gratitude, friendship, motivation, and happy endings. Similar to Dark Academia, Light Academia involves an interest in literature, music, art, history, and learning. Light Academia visuals, literary inspirations, and philosophical themes are generally Eurocentric and classicist. Some proponents of Light Academia have attempted to resist this Euro-centrism by utilizing academic clothing from non-Western European cultures, and recommending, quoting, and discussing books by non-European, non-English-speaking, and non-white authors.    However, visuals from classical antiquity still play a significant role in Light Academia, and the Western canon are a significant part of the philosophy. Western architecture, including church buildings, libraries, museums, and universities, feature frequently in Light Academia images. Haussmann-era Paris and images of domesticity also differentiate Light from Dark Academia.
