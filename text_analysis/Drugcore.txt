This page will talk a lot of heavy drug usage and, as a result, some particularly dark topics will come up. If you yourself have found that you've gone down this path and feel bad memories boiling up, we urge you to go to a safer page on here, and we hope you are getting the help you need. Viewer discretion is advised.Drugcore is an aesthetic centered completely around drug usage and what some people will do to chase that specific high. This particular aesthetic can face some backlash due to its seeming-glorification of abusing dangerous substances and getting high by any means necessary.
