Fairy Academia is a feminine, otherworldly offshoot of Dark Academia, inspired by the aesthetics of Victorian and Edwardian childhood.Fairy academics enjoy learning and education, as well as trickery and scheming - as in the 1917 Cottingley Fairy hoax, where two young girls used trick photography to con the populace into thinking there were real fairies in their garden.
