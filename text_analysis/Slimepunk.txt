Slimepunk is a musical micro-genre that emerged in the early 2010s among Internet communities. It is characterized by an aesthetic dominated by slime related pop culture references, ranging from the Toxic Avenger, slime-time live, mountain-dew, and toxic waste. Similar to Vaporwave and Seapunk, this aesthetic is an integral part of the genre and characterizes the artists who dive into the Slimepunk movement. Slimepunk music often times features heavy & distorted bass-lines and has emerged largely from a post-acid scene. Slime-punk artists tend to have a more aggressive or corrosive ethos in combination with their music. While there is no specific slime-punk sound, the aesthetic is a common unifying factor, and most Slimepunk artists feature heavy sampling within their music.
