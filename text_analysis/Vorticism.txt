Vorticism is an early 20th-century modernist movement in British art and poetry. It aimed to create art that expressed the dynamism of the modern world.  It was originally created in London by the writer and artist Wyndham Lewis back in 1914. Although it was based in London, it was international in make-up and ambition.
