The Reefwave visual aesthetic is essentially a different way of viewing Nautical; instead of focusing what the ocean is like from on land, collecting shells and walking on the beach, Reefwave focuses more on the ocean itself - in particular (but by no means exclusively), on the way water and waves affect the way light falls underwater. Reefwave's primary colors are various shades of blue and green, ranging out to yellow or purple in some examples (though not both at once). Its imagery depicts coral reefs, sea life, aquariums and nature.   Because much of Reefwave centers around the way light behaves, its aesthetics pop up often in video games, where refraction is a fairly common way to display the power of a game's graphics engine.
