Hauntology is a genre or loose category of music and art that aims to evoke deep cultural memory, concerning itself with aesthetics of the past. It developed in the 2000s primarily among British electronic musicians and typically draws on British cultural sources from the 1940s to the 1970s, including library music, film and TV soundtracks, psychedelia, and public information films, often through the use of sampling.
