Lo-Fi is a largely music-centric aesthetic that utilizes muted tones and mundane imagery to evoke a feeling of calm and nostalgia. Many elements of Lo-Fi are comparable to or heavily draw from to Vaporwave, Anime, Cartooncore, Spiritcore and Vintage. The genre (and associated aesthetic) is often loved for taking a genuine and longing approach to nostalgia while also encouraging people to stop in the moment and pay attention to the world around them.
