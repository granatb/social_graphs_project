Trigger warning: This page discusses issues of mental health, which, although not graphic, may be triggering for some readers. Please read at your own risk. Also, keep in mind that this shouldn't be used as just a cutesy aesthetic.Yami Kawaii (病みかわいい) is a Japanese aesthetic that was derived from Yume Kawaii with a stronger emphasis on dark themes and colors. It is part of Anti-Kawaii which adds opposing elements to typical the kawaii style in order to leave a greater impact. As the term can also be used as an adjective, its interpretation can vary a lot depending on the context as a character being described as Yami Kawaii can simply refer to their personality being dark and cute without visually representing the aesthetic.It is often confused with the Gurokawa trend, which revolves around horror and gore, but Yami Kawaii has more of shoujo spin to it with many manga-style illustrations, and is not bloody or gory.
