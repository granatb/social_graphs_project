Disclaimer: Do not be a creep, troll, bully, etc. on the internet. This is about creepy things on the internet, the dark web, and the overall mysterious and creepy content of the internet. This does not condone bullying or harassment on the internet of any kind.Web Creep is an aesthetic based around a mixture of multiple different aesthetics, but most notably cryptid core, adventure core, and after hours. It's inspired primarily through mysteries, true crime stories, creepy pastas, and any horror or scary content originating on the internet. For better context, imagine looking through the r/nosleep subreddit on a dark rainy night, or going on a deep dive on a urban legend or serial killer from your home town. It takes adventure and monster hunting, and applies it to web surfing and rabbit holes.There is also a lean towards computer science which can be anything in the field, such as software development, hacking, etc.  The dark web can also be included in this aesthetic, but do so at your own risk. Most people who fit this aesthetic are night owls, have a fascination with disturbing things, and prefer casual and comfy clothing. Similar to cryptid core, there is a desire to learn and research the oddities of the internet.
