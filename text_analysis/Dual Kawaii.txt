Dual Kawaii (formerly Karasu No Bara) mainly revolves around the feeling of being lost or trapped in the world, feeling tired and dull constantly, a general sense of hopelessness, being dissatisfied with how the world works, and wanting to feel apathy because too many thoughts and feelings have occurred. There is, however, a more optimistic side. It combines self-care, sensitivity, and charm into one aesthetic. It is both pessimistic and optimistic. This aesthetic is a form of healing, trying to find one's self, accept both sides of themselves and come to terms with who they really are. The aesthetic can also reflect the dual and, often contradiction, of visual taste between light and dark. This can apply to many variations of aesthetics but is mainly centered around the ones listed.
