Soft Apocalypse is the concept of society collapsing slowly or post catastrophe. Usually characterized by the decline of technology, abandoned cities full of wildlife. The surviving humans would be focused on food, shelter, and having to work together as a community rather than fighting or having to deal with whichever world ending event may be occurring. The technology they have might be solar, wind, or other renewable energy sources.
