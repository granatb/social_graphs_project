Lagenlook is a European clothing style that is designed to suit everyone and is ideal for those looking to put their own stamp on their fashion choice. Lagenlook is centred on the ideal of expression, pairing clothes and statement accessories to create unique looks that work perfectly for all body types. Lagenlook is closely tied to early feminism, and is similar aesthetically to the Bohemian aesthetic.
