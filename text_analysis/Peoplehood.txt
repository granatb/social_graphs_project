(This article is under construction)Peoplehood is an aesthetic on tumblr (currently) that revolves around the mundane acts of kindness and intimacy that are present in daily lives shared with the people surrounding them. The community surrounding that aesthetic stems from a shared admiration for poetry, quotes from literature, music, and artworks that are circulated via reblogs on tumblr. There is heavy emphasis on creating connections between certain imagery and motifs through creating moodboards and compilations/parallels/web-weaving (explained below). Certain works have become incredibly well-known and venerated in those circles, with those being the subject of many compilations and even memes. Some of the most popular include: "The Orange" by Wendy Cope, multiple Ocean Vuong poems, and "The Two-Headed Calf" by Laura Gilpin.
