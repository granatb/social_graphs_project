Bastardcore is supposed to strike your fight or flight response. It consists of friendly images along with shock humor themed captions or images that seem out of place and are uncomfortable to look at. One could argue that Bastardcore is an extension of the "cursed images'" meme. This aesthetic is commonly used by people who would refer to themselves as "feral".
