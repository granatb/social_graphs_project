Alternative is an umbrella term that can describe anything that sits outside of the mainstream. This could include Punk, Grunge, Emo, etc. Sometimes, if a subculture is particularly popular (rock is an example of this), alternative rock would be its own sub-genre outside of 'mainstream' rock.It is important to note that most aesthetics could fall under the alternative label nowadays. Additionally, the line between alternative and mainstream is becoming very blurred due to the power of the internet in promoting "underground" artists.Alternative originated as a genre of music, described by Merriam-Webster as "music that is produced by performers who are outside the musical mainstream, that is typically regarded as more eclectic, original, or challenging than most popular music (such as conventional rock, pop, or country), and that is often distributed by independent record labels."Due to this, in music terms, alternative and indie (independent) have similar connotations, indie meaning not associated with a mainstream record label. It is important to note that "indie" is not a specific sound, it better describes the way the sound is released.Alternative rock is the most popular genre of alternative music, and is what most people think of when alternative is mentioned. Alternative rock gained most of it's popularity from 1991 to 1996 when Nirvana released "Smells Like Teen Spirit", as described in this article.The title "alternative" has developed to often be used as a label for clothing that is outside current fashion trends. The label "alt" is also being used a lot on TikTok to describe the darkest themed fashion that doesn't fit into other categories.
