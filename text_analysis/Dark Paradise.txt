The Dark Paradise aesthetic focuses on images of serenity with a veil of darkness laid over it to rouse a sense of dark calmness. Dark Paradise revolves around visually dark photos, as if taken in the dark or in the late evening. This aesthetic is very versatile and can apply to other aesthetics due to the dark nature of common photos. The difference between this aesthetic and others is the feeling of inner peace and calmness.
