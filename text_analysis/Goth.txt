NSFW Content Warning: This page does make a brief mention about "Fetish Goth", which combines the Goth aesthetic with BDSM themes.This article discusses Goth music and the subculture surrounding it. For the art and literature that predated it, see Gothic.Goth is a music-based subculture that was formed in the late 1970s-to-early 1980s in the UK. Gothic rock originally derived from the post-punk movement at the time, which included acts, such as Joy Division, the Siouxsie and the Banshees. "Goth" as a term was originally used by music journalists to describe bands with dark subjects (the first of which was The Doors, with their track "The End"). However, goth as a concrete music genre didn't exist until the release of Bauhaus' debut single "Bela Lugosi's Dead." Since the release of that track, many bands have formed to create and expand on the genre, intentionally or not (a lot of the original bands that are considered staples of goth rock actually hate the label, especially musicians such as Andrew Eldritch of Sisters of Mercy). Today, goth still thrives as an underground subculture with many organized events and festivals (most popular is the annual Wave-Gotik-Treffen, or WGT for short, which takes place in Leipzig, Germany).
