The formal Regency era lasted from 1811 to 1820 AD, but the period from 1795 to 1837 AD is also sometimes regarded as part of the Regency era. Technically the term Regency refers to a time period in British history, but it is commonly applied to the same time period in other countries, such as France, Russia, and the United States, because of the wide reach of the aesthetic. In the US, this time period is sometimes referred to as the Federalist Era.
