Acidwave is centered around visuals inspired by depictions of hallucinations caused by hallucinogenic drugs, especially lysergic acid diethylamide, colloquially known as acid, from which the aesthetic derives its name. It started as a subgenre of House music that was popular in raves (which could draw some comparisons to Raver culture) but has evolved into a full blown aesthetic in its own right.
