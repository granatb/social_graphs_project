Thank you.Erokawa (エロカワ) is a japanese aesthetic that is supposed to contrast the popular kawaii trends by drawing notions of the western concept of sexiness. The term, coined in 2005, is a fusion of ero (shortened from the English word "erotic", which has negative connotations in Japanese culture) and the lighter kawaii, meaning "cute".Nowadays, it mostly refers to anything erotic that was inspired by kawaii culture.
