Prairiecore is based off of the life of the American pioneers and life on the prairie. Batsheva Hay describes her inspiration to be the "eccentric" tastes of her mother and grandmother. Though inspired by the U.S, Prairiecore is not limited to the United States. Like the American pioneers, this aesthetic finds power in freedom and experimenting with new things by using the old as inspiration. Its fashion has both a traditional and modern variant (Uptown Prairie). Key things are grasslands, cattle, flowers, wheat, and Pioneer related works. Prairiecore emerged from the American boho aesthetic during the 1970's, as an offshoot of the hippie/ flowerchild movement. The brand Gunne Sax by Jessica popularized prairie dresses in boho culture at the time, and continues to influence modern prairiecore style.
