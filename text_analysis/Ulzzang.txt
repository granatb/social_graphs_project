Ulzzang, (얼짱) is a popular South Korean term literally meaning "best face", deriving from the Korean words face (얼굴) and best (짱). A person desiring ulzzang status would gain popularity on the internet through entering contests where their photos are judged and chosen by voters. The trend is unisex and is practiced by both males and females. The term replaced King Car and Queen Car in popularity, and has since been succeeded by Heeulsa.
