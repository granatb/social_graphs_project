Voidpunk is a subculture among dehumanized groups that is normally described as the rejection of the human identity, and embracing being nonhuman. Both go along with applying those concepts to one's self, as a way of getting back at the dehumanization society has applied to them. While these are popular descriptors of the subculture, it is also up to the person's and community's personal perspective and experiences to describe Voidpunk. It is exclusively for groups and individuals who face dehumanization from society. Some groups included in that experience are a-spec people, nonbinary people, neurodivergent people, disabled people, and many more.
