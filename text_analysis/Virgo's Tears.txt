Virgo's Tears is an aesthetic formed around the small, frail flower, and the grand, nigh-infinite cosmos, and the natural beauty between their distinct difference, as well as mystical uses of both, such as tarot. The art also has a philosophical tone along with the feeling of understanding and appreciation of togetherness, the goal of growing into the bright bloom we want to be, to change and grow, to live a life full of our own beauty, inside and out. There is also an urge to surround oneself with friends and help them grow and bloom as well. Out-of-body experiences and ideals that connect many facets of your personality give a wider spectrum of perspective, as opposed to the simplicity of a single.
