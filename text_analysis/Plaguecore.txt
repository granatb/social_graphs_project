Plaguecore is an aesthetic about plague doctors. The community is super friendly although behind their masks you might not know, but they are willing to listen to your needs and they'll do their best to cure you. But if you upset them they will be sure to mess up your humors.The aesthetic revolves around mostly black and grays, leeches, bloodletting, lavender, cloaks, bird masks, and dark humor. This aesthetic was also created on Tumblr: Posts tagged with plaguecore on Tumblr
