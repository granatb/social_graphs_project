Kawaii (かわいい) is a Japanese term and aesthetic referring to the unique concept affirming childlike and pretty things that make your heart flutter. However, different from the English word "cute", it is peculiar in that it's so diversified that it spawned many subgenres which often are far removed from the original concept. For example, Gurokawa refers to "creepy cute" things and Erokawa to everything "erotic but cute" that appeals to the sexual desire. The concept of kawaii is often misunderstood in foreign countries and often wrongly applied to anything "chibi".
