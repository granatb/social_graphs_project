Bikers are a subculture revolving around riding motorcycles, and the lifestyle/culture associated with it. The Biker Aesthetic is not quite the bike itself, or anyone who rides one, but a specific type of style and attitude that is associated with it. The biker aesthetic is an image of toughness, roughness, sex appeal, and danger.
