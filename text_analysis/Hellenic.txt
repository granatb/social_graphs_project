Hellenic is an aesthetic based on Greek mythology and the word Hellenic itself. Hellenic is a word to describe the people, language, and culture of ancient Greece. The aesthetic itself may not have a huge following, but Tumblr and Pinterest have a huge following for Greek mythology and do many things that this aesthetic includes. It is clear they would take part in this aesthetic once they know its existence. The Percy Jackson fandom who identifies as half-bloods sorted in the cabin of their "god parent" would also fit in this aesthetic perfectly. Many practicing occultists, pagans, and witches could be a fan of this aesthetic as they adopt Greek deities as their patron and matrons gods and goddesses, often involving them in their everyday lives. This can range from creating altars to communicating to them through divination. Learning about deities' associations, preferences, and mythos are key to connecting and working with them. Adopting positive traits and habits associated with a certain deity can bring one even closer to understanding that deity, also. This could mean practicing self-care and self-love in honor of Aphrodite, or working hard and honestly in school in honor of Athena, as examples. The aesthetic would be having a great love, respect, or interest in Greek myth/Hellenic that affects your wardrobe or way of life. It is like Cottagecore and Dark Academia in the way that the aesthetic has a style, activities, lifestyle, beliefs, and more that is based on a subject or theme. Though it may be different for people, some may only do a few things, while others may completely stylize their life on the aesthetic. This is a different aesthetic to Classicism, which is the history and culture of Ancient Greece and Rome, whereas this is a contemporary interpretation of Ancient Greek culture that came about from internet teens' renewed interest in mythology.
