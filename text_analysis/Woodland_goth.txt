Woodland Goth is an Internet aesthetic that combines dark, romantic elements of Goth culture with light subjects like flowers or soft woodland animals. The aesthetic is based off woodland survival and agriculture with a gothic twist. Elements of woodland goth have been taken from Goblincore, Fairycore, Cottagecore and goth.
