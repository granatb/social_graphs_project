Notes: This aesthetic article touches on the aesthetic's controversial origin based on race and gender, we at the Aesthetic Wiki do not hold any discriminatory and/or hateful beliefs against those who hold this aesthetic. Please read at your own risk.  The Common White Girl aesthetic, also known as Basic White Girl, originated in the early 2010s through black artists' observation and riffing. A Common White Girl is identified by her perceived love of Starbucks or Dunkin, wearing Ugg boots and yoga pants, a sense of shallowness, and a lack of authenticity. This aesthetic was created through a negative view of popular trends seen mostly adopted by white teenagers and young adults, and is often used as an insult to these demographics. This aesthetic is often used by major media companies when creating female characters to make them more relatable to a larger audience.
