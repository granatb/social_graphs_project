Glowwave is an aesthetic surrounding the theme of things that glow in the dark or with assistance from a UV light (also commonly called a blacklight) or with the glow of neon lights and bright, neon colors. It is closely associated with raving or just good old-fashioned partying (similar to Cuddle Party), though it can have ties to the old Hippie culture.
