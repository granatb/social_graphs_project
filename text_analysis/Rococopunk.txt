Rococopunk is a punk derivative that thrusts punk attitude into the late Baroque period. Although it is a fairly recent derivative, it is a style that is visually similar to the New Romantic movement of the 1980s (particularly such groups as Adam and the Ants). Rococopunk has most recently been featured on The X Factor through the artist known as Prince Poppycock. Fashion designer Vivienne Westwood, often known as "the Queen of Punk Fashion", also mixes Rococo with punk stylings.
