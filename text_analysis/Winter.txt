Winter is the coldest season of the year in polar and temperate zones. It involves snow, sweaters/jumpers, the colour white, and the cold. It can also be a reference to Winter fashion styles.During this time of the year, people tend to stay more at their homes to not be exposed to the low temperatures, making the season be associated with more calm, cozy elements. Some examples are staying at home near a fireplace, wrapped around a blanket, watching a movie, and reading books. It is also closely tied to the holiday of Christmas, which in itself has values of unity and kindness. Foods are served while hot, such as hot cocoa, tea, lace and gingerbread cookies, fruitcakes, soup, and ham.Winter isn't always a low energy time for everyone, since it has various exclusive sports and activities. This can include sledding, skiing, ice-skating, hockey, snowball fights, and curling, to name a few.
