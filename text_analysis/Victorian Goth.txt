Victorian Goth is a style that merges the classic trends of Victorian fashion with Goth sensibilities. Not to be confused with Romantic Goth, which pulls inspiration from the Romantic era which began at the end of the 18th century and ended in the mid-1800s before the Victorian era had properly landed.
