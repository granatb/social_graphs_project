Fractal art is a form of algorithmic art created by calculating fractal objects and representing the calculation results as still images, animations, and media. Fractal art developed from the mid-1980s onwards. It is a genre of computer art and digital art.The mathematical beauty of fractals lies at the intersection of generative art and computer art. They combine to produce a type of abstract art.
