Vacation Dadcore is a style aesthetic focusing on Hawaiian prints, socks and sandals, wide-brim hats, tan lines and that relaxing vacation lifestyle. The aesthetic stems from the low effort, comfortable but also practical style commonly worn by dads on holiday. Each dad is different and thus the aesthetic is diverse; polo shirts, button-downs or even vests are all well within the Vacation Dadcore aesthetic, as it only truly is Vacation Dadcore if you don't really care what you're wearing and just want to get a tan.
