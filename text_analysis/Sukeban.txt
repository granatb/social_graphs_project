Sukeban (スケバン) is a Japanese fashion derived from the looks of Japanese girl gangs. The term is slang that translates as "girl boss" and is mainly used to refer to a violent feminist movement that emerged in Japan in the late 60s. As male gangs - also known as yanki -  originally didn't allow female members, the girls started a distinct identity of their own.
