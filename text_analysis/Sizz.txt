Sizz is a relatively new aesthetic that focuses on noise, distortion and other artifacts as a way to modify the subject of an image and make it more abstract. Though named in 2017 following a trend found on sites like Tumblr and Instagram, sizz is in fact a more modern evolution of several older aesthetics - a sort of combination of the German expressionist method of abstraction to build a sense of mood, the emotion created by contrast and lighting in American film noir, and the way the Japanese are-bure-bokeh street photography movement embraces griminess and lack of focus in its snapshots. The term "sizz" is intended as onomatopoeia to simulate the sound of noise - according to Merriam-Webster, the word "sizz" means "to hiss or move with a hissing sound."
