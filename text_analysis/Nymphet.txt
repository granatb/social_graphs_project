This is a sensitive topic. Many would argue that buying into this aesthetic and subculture is not far from romanticization of pedophilia. Please research the implications of this style thoroughly before making the decision to involve yourself in it. If this makes you uncomfortable, but you do like the look, you can still be a part of the Nymphet community and frown upon people in the community who do romanticize pedophilia. It's still necessary to acknowledge even harmful influences on modern visual culture, but we at the Aesthetics Wiki DO NOT condone the romanticization of pedophilia and child abuse. 	 	 	 		 		 		 	 Nymphet is an aesthetic based on a novel written by Vladimir Nabokov - "Lolita", published in 1955 and its movie adaptations from 1962 and 1997. Nymphet is an illusion created in the mind of Humbert Humbert, the (unreliable) main character and narrator of both the films and book. For the term, it is used by Humbert as a way to justify his predatory actions towards Dolores Haze, his victim. As an aesthetic, this word refers to the style of Dolores Haze in the movies, that influences the fashion nowadays. It mostly revolves around youth, summer dresses, and carefree fun.
