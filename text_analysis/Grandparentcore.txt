Visual depiction of the two aesthetics 		 	 Grandparentcore is an aesthetic related to the common aesthetic depiction of grandparents as a whole. It is a comfortable, whimsical (but not necessarily chaotic) and comfortable aesthetic centered around focusing on things we enjoy most. Though it may appear simple or even naive at first glance, grandparentcore implies a certain level of expert knowledge in various topics or activities. Most of the things that are involved with grandparentcore are old, vintage, or even antique as it is implied that they have been used or were invented a long time ago. This aesthetic is split into two different aesthetics: Grandmacore and Grandpacore. Though these two groups fall very neatly into binary gender categories, they tend to overlap or borrow from each other. They aren't Female-Grandparentcore and Male-grandparentcore; they are two groups under one overarching umbrella.
