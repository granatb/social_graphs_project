Ero guro (a Japanese romanization of the terms in English "erotic" and "grotesque") is a Japanese literary and artistic movement that combines eroticism, horror, decadence, and deviancy. However, in contemporary times, it is linked with pornography that incorporates blood-to the point of confusing the word "guro" with "gore"- which may or may not follow the philosophy associated with ero guro.
