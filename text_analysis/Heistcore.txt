Heistcore is associated with thieves and heists, the elaborate thefts of data, money, art, jewels, and historical documents. Heistcore aesthetics can be found in espionage, crime, and detective media. Because of the value of the stolen goods, heists are considered more high class than cons in general. The title Gentleman Thief is sometimes applied to males who participate in heists, especially in media set during the Golden Age of Detective Fiction. The female equivalent is the Cat Burglar.
