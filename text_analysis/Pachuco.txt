Zoot Suit 		 	 Disclaimer: Chicanos/Mexican-Americans may be uncomfortable with Non-Chicanos adopting this identity as an aesthetic. Pachucos were targeted and faced xenophobic and racist hate crimes in the United States because they were easily recognized by their clothing. Also, the Pachuco and Pachuca identities were closely tied with Chicano right's movements. Therefore, if any non-Chicanos adopt this identify as an aesthetic, it will be cultural appropriation. Please be respectful of Chicano/Mexican-American culture, and feel free to discuss.Pachuco refers to a subculture of Chicanos and Mexican-Americans, associated with zoot suits, street gangs, nightlife, and flamboyant public behavior. Pachuca is the female counterpart, often idealized as a beautiful Chicana woman in extravagant evening dress or a female version of the zoot suit, out with a pachuco boyfriend for a night on the town. Pachucas broke taboos of their time by wearing men's-style pants sometimes and appearing in public often with their pachuco boyfriends; at the time, a "good woman" was considered to have her place in the home.
