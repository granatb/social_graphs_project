Please note that this page exists for the purposes of documentation, not promotion. Due to the role the Nazi Party played in history and the subsequent sensitive and offensive nature of this aesthetic, it is not recommended that you adopt it for yourself, but if you do, be prepared to be openly mocked and ridiculed. Aesthetics Wiki does not endorse Nazi ideology - but it is important to acknowledge its impact on modern culture.Fashwave (a portmanteau of the terms "fascism" and "wave") is a derivative aesthetic of Synthwave or Vaporwave that is associated with alt-right/far-right/dissident right beliefs like upholding tradition, maintaining racial purity, Anti-Semitism, ultranationalism, and a rejection of post-modernist thought (which a lot of the modern aesthetics on this Wiki are actually examples of). It's not unusual for people from the Fashwave scene to try and assimilate into the more "mainstream" Synthwave or Vaporwave scenes, but they are often sniffed out pretty quickly and given the boot because nobody wants to associate with actual Neo-Nazis.Fashwave is just an extension of the alt-right, an amalgamation of various far-right groups such as Neo-Nazis, Neo-Confederates, skinheads (nothing to do with the Skinheads aesthetic), white nationalists, white supremacists, and other like-minded individuals in an attempt to establish a wholly white ethnostate by any means necessary (though they'll never actually admit it because they know their actual worldview is highly unpopular these days).  For more information on how the alt-right operate, please check out the video in the gallery below entitled "The Alt-Right Playbook: How to Radicalize a Normie"; it's a long video, but it can really show how they're able to recruit otherwise-normal people and highlights why they decided to create Fashwave (as well as infiltrate the Cottagecore community).
