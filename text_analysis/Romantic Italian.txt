Romantic Italian is an aesthetic built upon the romanticism of the culture of Italy, particularly its idyllic countrysides, rich history, fashion culture, and languid society. The participants of this aesthetic place a great importance on appreciation of the arts and the luxurious lives of the Italian nobility, such as in masked balls. The aesthetic is able to blend the cosmopolitan Renaissance cities of Florence, Rome, and Venice with the countryside. Luxury is also an important part of the aesthetic, as activities associated with the leisure class, such as buying luxury goods and frequent traveling, are frequent subjects of these photos. It often overlaps with Vintage Parisian, but its regional focus, emphasis on Classicism, and the addition of rural, almost Cottagecore, stylings distinguishes it from its French counterpart.
