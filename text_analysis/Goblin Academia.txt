Goblin Academia is the cross between Goblincore and Academia, especially Green Academia and Chaotic Academia. Goblincore primarily focuses on the appreciation of aspects of nature which are normally overlooked, such as snails and mushrooms. Goblin Academia takes this a step further into studying these parts of nature. Itâ€™s for this reason why Goblin Academia could be seen as a sub-genre of Green Academia. Whereas Dark Academics are known for studying literature, art, and history, and Green Academics are known for studying Earth Sciences, a Goblin Academic would likely be interested in any or all of these fields. They would especially be interested in studying Nature-based literature, art, Mythology, botany, geology, and zoology.
