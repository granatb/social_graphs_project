Jamcore is an aesthetic based on picnics, gingham patterns, pastries, and jam. Jamcore is also based upon helping the environment, such as reusing jars and other materials, or being self sustainable if possible and growing your own food. Conserving the environment and wildlife is also a big part of Jamcore. It takes heavy inspiration from the Honeycore aesthetic as well, and are related in many ways.
