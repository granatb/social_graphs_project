Ravencore is an aesthetic influenced by Goblincore and Cottagecore. Ravencore is similar to, but not the same as, Crowcore. Ravencore is a nature-centered aesthetic, taking inspiration from ravens themselves. In nature, ravens generally prefer undisturbed mountainous or forested areas over urban areas (unlike crows); feed on scavenged carrion, small invertebrates, and insects; gather in groups (though they are usually seen alone or in pairs); and are known to hoard shiny objects. Ravencore is built around these basic principles.Members of Ravencore often collect rocks, minerals, crystals, moss, candles, bones/skulls, insects, and other natural "trinkets". Oftentimes, the aesthetic centers around friendship with wild corvids and a broad respect for nature.Ravens, followers of the ravencore aesthetic, are often very prideful of their collection and enjoy displaying and sharing it with others.This style embraces misty, mossy, shaded forests. If you are looking for a grittier, muddier, and brighter aesthetic you may want to consider Goblincore.
