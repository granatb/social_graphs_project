Holographic items are often confused with iridescent, multi-chrome, and any item with a shiny surface. They are different but can be confused with each other.Sometimes, if paired with lyrics or quotes, they are usually from artists such as Lana del Rey, Marina and the Diamonds, The Arctic Monkeys, Melanie Martinez, Billie Eilish, and Lorde. These artists tend to sing about their current situation and emotions, creating a zone of in the now, absorbed in the now. They talk very poetically, describing experiences quite deeply and eclectically. Some examples are moments when you are loving someone, how disastrous and messy they are, and what they want to or are doing right now.
