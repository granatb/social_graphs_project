A Femme Fatale is a mysterious, intelligent, beautiful, and seductive woman whose charms ensnare anyone who meets her, often leading them into deadly traps and webs of crime. Adherents to the Femme Fatale aesthetic try their best to embody the traits of the classic femme fatale archetype, which leads to a lot of crossover with the Baddie aesthetic, with one of the key differences between the two is the Femme Fatale has an air of mystery and elegance to her, whereas the Baddies adhere to a more "what you see is what you get" philosophy.
