Pigeoncore is an aesthetic surrounding the theme or hoarding and nature but includes that of birds (most notably, pigeons). Themed around softer aspects of hoarding, collecting, cooking, and other goblincore essentials, focuses on the softer curiosity rather than the goblin-ey nature. Can be considered a combination of goblincore, cottagecore, and bird-based aesthetics.
