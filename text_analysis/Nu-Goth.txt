Nu Goth is a modern take on goth subculture that is heavily rooted and influenced by traditional gothic music, aesthetic and philosophy. Its followers are deeply philosophical by nature and have a great interest in studying the human condition often through psychology, philosophy, and the occult. For this reason occult clothing, symbology and sacred geometry is a vast part of the Nu Goth aesthetic and fashion.
