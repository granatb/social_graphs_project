Visual Kei (V系) is a Japanese fashion movement among Japanese musical artists with influences based in Glam Rock, Goth, Punk and traditional Japanese clothing, whereas the fans and their aesthetic are refered to as Bangya (バンギャ).The results of this conglomeration of influences include very flamboyant and big hair, heavy makeup, and elaborate costumes of varying styles. Determining whether a band is visual kei or not is generally rather easy - it can be as simple as looking at images of the band, and either the fans or the artists themselves will be sure to let you know if they are, as it's generally a conscious choice to be a part of the scene.  As it is primarily a visual style, it's impossible to pin down visual kei by hearing alone, and to dismiss a band as "not visual kei" based on their sound is unwise, as the music can range from J-pop to extreme metal to electronic dance music.
