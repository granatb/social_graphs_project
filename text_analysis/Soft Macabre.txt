Soft Macabre is an aesthetic that evokes both creepiness and softness at the same time. Unlike something like Macaute, Soft Macabre is purely black and white, and is usually more about photography than it is art. Soft Macabre is grungy in its visuals, with grains and other messy filters being a key part of the Soft Macabre aesthetic.
