Cagole refers to women originating from the French Riviera who dress and behave as "bimbos". It made its debuts as a slightly offensive slang word in the early-mid 2000's, but quickly was reclaimed as a proper lifestyle by cagoles themselves. The aesthetic encountered an agonizing death in the mid 2010's, although the term is still used in its home region.
