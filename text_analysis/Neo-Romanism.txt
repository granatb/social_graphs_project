Neo-Romanism is an aesthetic influenced by Bronzepunk, Sandalpunk, Neoclassicism, Futurism and Renaissance, among others. It is also the judicial system that governs many 21st century democracies. Neo-Romanism began to boom with the popularization of neo-pagan religions such as Hellenism and the Roman Way at the end of the 20th Century, which have influenced its "romantic" vision of those times.
