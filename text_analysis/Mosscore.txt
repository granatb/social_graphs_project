Mosscore is an aesthetic that focuses on forest and moss related things and objects. The main focus is dark, mossy forests and sometimes things like fungi and liverworts are prevalent. The main colour scheme is mostly various, usually dark, shades of green, browns and other natural hues, and light/bright colours almost never pop up. Man made objects in this aesthetic include, but are not limited to, shacks, huts and cabins. This aesthetic is closely related to other forest-themed aesthetics like Forestpunk, Cottagecore, and Mushroomcore.
