Metalcore (or metallic hardcore) is a fusion music genre that combines elements of extreme metal and hardcore punk together. Among other styles blending metal and hardcore, such as crust punk and grindcore, metalcore is noted for its use of breakdowns, which are slow, intense passages conducive to moshing. The first bands to make music in this style was Integrity and the New York Hardcore bands in the late 1980s alongside the birth of crossover Thrash. Other defining instrumentation includes heavy guitar riffs, occasional blast beats, and double bass drumming. Vocalists in the genre typically perform yelling or screaming. Some later metalcore bands often combine this with the use of clean singing, with the singing often happening during the chorus of the song. Death growls and gang vocals also are somewhat common types of vocals in metalcore.
