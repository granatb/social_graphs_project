Geek is a slang term originally used to describe eccentric or non-mainstream people; in current use, the word typically connotes an expert or enthusiast or a person obsessed with a hobby or intellectual pursuit, usually technology, with a general pejorative meaning of a "peculiar person, especially one who is perceived to be overly intellectual, unfashionable, boring, or socially awkward".The term "nerd" is frequently used interchangeably with and has definitional similarities to "geek". However, some have identified connotative differences between the terms.
