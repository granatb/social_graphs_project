Anglocore involves the use of English-themed motifs to generate images with themes of patriotic and nationalistic sentiment for England and English ethno-culture. It has been seen as an expression of indigenous pride of the English people as any image perceived as inherently English falls under the Anglocore banner. It buys into the philosophy that the future of England rightfully belongs to the English people alone.
