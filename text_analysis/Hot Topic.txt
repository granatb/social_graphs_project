Hot Topic is an aesthetic surrounding the fashion and products from the shop, Hot Topic, throughout its long and storied history. Seen as the epicenter for many an aesthetic popular throughout the 90's and into the present day, Hot Topic has faced criticism for being both a bandwagon rider in terms of what's popular as well as being incredibly overpriced (considering you can get a lot of the same merchandise at other stores for cheaper prices).
