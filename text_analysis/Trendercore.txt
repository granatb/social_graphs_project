Trendercore is an aesthetic created by uwumars on Tumblr, dedicated to transgender and non-binary self-love. The aesthetic centers around self-love, self-acceptance, bright colors, and social justice. There is an emphasis on embracing physical traits in transgender individuals that transmedicalists often highlight as indicative of a "transtrender," a derogatory term for a person who pretends to be transgender. However, not every transgender or nonbinary person will have debilitating gender dysphoria that constantly wrecks havoc on their lives. Some trans people love their bodies in every shape and form but would feel comfortable with another gender than their assigned one at birth.
