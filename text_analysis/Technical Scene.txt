Technical Scene is usually classified by a mix between usual dark goth and emo culture, and modern or past technology and machinery, such as motherboards or typewriters.The origins of the aesthetic are currently unknown, as so is the time of origin. It can be assumed it's between the 1980s and 2010s, a main era of technology and dark themes.
