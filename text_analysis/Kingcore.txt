Kingcore is a variant of Royalcore that revolves around the imagery and power of portrayed kings in history, folklore, and fictional work. Like Queencore is to Princesscore, Kingcore is a more mature variant of Princecore. Themes of power, war, and conquest are more often seen here, as kings are most often viewed as malicious entities; although this is not true for all works or historical accounts. Kingcore aesthetics show through strength and guidance, skill and patience. Those who adopt a Kingcore aesthetic may be seen as the leader of a group. They hold themselves to higher standards, as a way to show worthiness of their title and position. The Kingcore aesthetic wouldn't be complete without confidence and displays of good leadership. A different approach using evil kings as inspiration can prove ill-advised, as this may make the person appear selfish and inconsiderate with a disregard for others.Inspiration can be drawn from patriarchal figures in hierarchy-centered shows and movies, especially those centered around kingdoms. For a darker approach, colors can be toned deeper, and inspiration can be drawn from evil king characters and CEOs. This aesthetic can be great inspiration for modern styles.
