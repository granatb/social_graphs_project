Waldorf is a teaching style created by Rudolph Steiner in 1919. However, as the education movement has grown, it has also established itself as its own aesthetic. The Aesthetic is very much related to cottagecore but without the French Impressionist inspirations. Unlike the educational style, the aesthetic of Waldorf is for all ages and nearly universal.  	 	 	 		 			 		 		 		 			A Waldorf style watercolor piece. Notice the colors and brush stroke style.

Waldorf is very similar to a more colorful, and childish Wicca aesthetic and is the primary decorative style of choice for many Wiccans/Witches, especially those with children.
