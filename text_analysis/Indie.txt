The indie aesthetic is based on individuality and independence. There are two camps of Indie, as the aesthetic underwent a modern resurgence in 2019-2020 labeled Indie Kid. Indie Kid is a bright, colorful style usually involving oversized jeans, large hoodies, and small shirts. This aesthetic rose to fame again through the app TikTok and centers around bright colors, 2000s-style fashion, and a skater lifestyle. This resurgence differs from the original Indie style which did not include such bright colors and was considered more "alternative" by today's standards. This style involved a variety of independent music genres, including shoegaze. This can also include the indie movie genre, as many movies in the genre add to the original indie aesthetic.
