Cybergoth is a subculture that derives from elements of Goth, Raver, Rivethead, and Cyberpunk subcultures. Cybergoths are often considered part of the industrial subculture, and not the Goths (if due to the fact the Goths have absolutely no love for the Cybergoths whatsoever).Some people don't think Cybergoth is a subculture in itself, but more of a variation in aesthetic on cyberpunk or raver fashion. Cyber Kei would be a Japanese substyle that mixes it with elements of Visual Kei.
