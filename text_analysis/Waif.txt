Trigger warning: This article discusses drugs, eating disorders, slurs, and mental illness. If this sort of content has the potential to be triggering to you, please turn back from this page. Waif is a type of blogger who posts content relating to rich, beautiful, intelligent, self-destructive, and manipulative teenage girls, wherein the imagery reflects the lifestyle that such a young woman would have. Largely, "nepotism girls" (female celebrities who got to their fame via nepotism), models, ballet dancers, and rebellious boarding school students are examples of these types of characters.   Arguably, it can be seen as a continuation of Heroin Chic, and it was influenced by Dark Nymphet, Fairy Grunge, and the humor of the podcast The Red Scare. In addition to aesthetic images, much of this information comes from memes, whisper confessions, and text posts of things happening within their personal lives.  What distinguishes this aesthetic from the previous aesthetics above is the persona of these bloggers. Rather than portraying themselves as delicate and broken, they put on a confidence and rudeness that shows independence and openness. Specifically, the memes and text posts produced have a flippant or egocentric tone. However, these girls are using it as an expression of their mental illness. In addition to the glamour of independent and precocious lives of parties, money, and influence, there are multiple references to drug use, depression, and the desire for gaining attention from their looks.
