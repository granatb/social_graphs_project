Pastel Goth (not to be confused with Gurokawa or Nu-Goth) is a fashion that first emerged from groups on VK.com and later spread to Tumblr in the early 2010. It is a result of mixing goth or grunge with the sweet pastel elements of the kawaii aesthetic, but also a touch of bohemian chic. It also spread in popularity in Japan for a brief period thanks to the DJ Juria Nakagawa who's style has always been highly influenced by what is popular on Tumblr.
