Thrasher, as we are choosing to use it in this context, refers to metalheads who have a specific preference to the thrash metal subgenre. Playing off of the roots of heavy metal, thrash got its start in the early 80s with a group of bands commonly known as the "Big 4" of thrash: Metallica, Slayer, Anthrax, and later Megadeth after Dave Mustaine's departure from Metallica.
