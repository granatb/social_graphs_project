Foodie is a gourmet or a person who has an ardent/refined interest in food and alcoholic beverages. It involves seeking new food experiences as a hobby rather than simply eating out of convenience or hunger. The Foodie aesthetic, however, is dedicated to showing off these foods in very aesthetically pleasing manners. You may also take note of the color combinations, plating arrangement, and composition in their photographs.
