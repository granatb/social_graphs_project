Tomboy is a type of girl who exhibits characteristics or behaviors considered typical of a boy. Common characteristics include wearing masculine clothing and engaging in games and activities that are physical in nature and are considered in many cultures to be unfeminine or the domain of boys. This aesthetic often features feminist themes. Tomboys are free-spirited, tough, and wild. They love to do fun things and be free to live the way they like. They are also often more chill and quiet in comparison to other girls.The tomboy concept has developed over the years, as stated in this article. Around the 1840s-1860s the tomboy concept was actually rooted in racist and misogynistic ideas. Since white people feared that their race would die out, they became concerned for the health of white women and therefore encouraged them to lead more active and typically male life styles. This was also thought to prepare them for marriage and motherhood. This later linked to third wave feminism.Some tomboys identify as part of the LGBTQ+ community and are lesbian and/or queer, and tomboyism is often associated with Butch/Stud Lesbianism and rejects traditional gender norms for girls and women, who identify with a more masculine identity. However, you do not need to be LGBTQ+ to be a tomboy. Anybody of any background, lifestyle, and orientation can be a tomboy.
