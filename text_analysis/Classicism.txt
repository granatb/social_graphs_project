Classicism, in the arts, refers generally to a high regard for a classical period, classical antiquity in the Western tradition, as setting standards for taste which the classicists seek to emulate. The art of classicism typically seeks to be formal and restrained. It is a specific genre of philosophy, expressing itself in literature, architecture, art, and music, which has Ancient Greek and Roman sources and an emphasis on society.In some situations, classicism can be politicized by white nationalists with the intention of creating an impression of "Western culture" from many diverse cultures. This can then be portrayed as "what we [the white race] are protecting," an ahistorical medley of very different "white" cultures. (Source.) Note that while this may be difficult to distinguish from legitimate cultural study in some cases, that is the purpose of such politicization; it prevents everyone from immediately seeing through the veil of cryptofascism. This by no means forms the majority of the classicist aesthetic, however (and thankfully).For the modern reinterpretation of classicism based on mythology, see Hellenic.
