Please note that this page is currently under construction and incompleteDaydreampunk is a sub-genre of punk that specializes in daydream-themed visuals. It consists of bright or pastel "magical" colors with fantasy elements such as unicorns or fairies laid out on a punk canvas. It takes inspiration heavily from late 2000s and early 2010s trends and aesthetics for young/tween girls. It can consist of bright galaxy prints, tie-dye, studded denim, and holographic punk-style shoes. It bears some resemblance to the Spacecore, Holosexual, and Unicorncore genres.
