Boujee (also spelled Bougie), a colloquially shortening of the term "bourgeoisie", is a critical term used to describe the wealthier side of the middle class. The term is used with both positive and negative connotations, as it can be a goal for many yet offensive to many more, as people who are overwhelmingly wealthy are often blind to the struggles of those without such wealth and opportunity. The  term "bourgeoisie" refers to the middle and upper classes that own capital (money, machinery, and other resources used to create more wealth), as opposed to the working class or "proletariat". Hence, this aesthetic is most often associated with celebrities and wealthy business owners and their heirs.  Boujee people are concerned with wealth, status, and all thing luxury. They'll often show off, or "flex", their wealth on social media to gain notoriety and followers, or "clout". Often these flexes will include expensive spa trips, high-end self care and cosmetics, buying expensive foreign vehicles or mansions, trips to luxury resorts and beaches, and more activities of this sort. Boujee people typically radiate confidence and esteem, and can be very charitable. However, they can easily turn to narcissism and entitlement. In any case, hedonism and living life on their terms are some of the main values of boujee life. This is very similar to Baddie, but more refined.
