Comiccore is an aesthetic which reflects the themes and motifs of Western comics, particularly those created in America between 1920 and 1960. While comics are a wide and diverse medium, all are made distinct by certain technical limitations, such as dot matrixes, sequential storytelling, four-color inks, and pulp paper, all of which add substantially to a comic vibe. Unlike Pop Art, which can sometimes include comic elements (as in the case of Roy Lichtenstein's famous piece Whaam) comiccore is less self-referential and deconstructive, instead referring to the inherent and unique properties of comics themselves. Comiccore does not concern superheroes, which dominate the industry to the extent they constitute an entirely separate aesthetic, or Manga, which is thematically and visually as far removed from Western comics as Anime is from Western cartoons.
