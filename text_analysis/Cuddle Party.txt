The Cuddle Party aesthetic is centered around positive feelings and a youthful/nostalgic vibe without delving as much into some of the childish elements of Kidcore. It's more in line with the moment and thinking about the good memories than with any sort of material element. This is generally an aesthetic embraced by more extroverted individuals and doesn't have an ounce of cynicism behind it like most other aesthetics. The old MTV show Sifl & Olly would probably describe this particular aesthetic as "crescent fresh".
