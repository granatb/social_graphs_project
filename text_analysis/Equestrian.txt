Equestrian is an aesthetic that relates to the art of horseback riding and horses in general. It features motifs related to horses like saddles, horseshoes and riding on horseback.Although equestrians are often ignorantly called "Horse Girls", the aesthetic of being an equestrian is very different. A "Horse Girl" is typically understood to be a young girl in a "horse phase" who acts like a horse, only talks about horses, and is generally crazy. An equestrian, on the other hand, can be a person of any gender who appreciates horses and the art of riding.
