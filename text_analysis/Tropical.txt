Tropical is an aesthetic that is based on comfort, ease, and utility and is eclectic by definition. The style is characterized by warm and soothing themes and colors drawn mostly from natural elements such as the sea, sky, and vegetation (plants, fruits, flowers, etc). Hues may be deep and rich or may fall on the lighter, brighter side.
