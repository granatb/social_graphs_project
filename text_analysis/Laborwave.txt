Laborwave  is a derivative of Vaporwave that is less subtle about its critiques of capitalism and take advantage of this aspect of Vaporwave to promote a communist or socialist agenda. Laborwave creators (much like Fashwave creators) will often confuse Synthwave aesthetics and Vaporwave aesthetics, which generally leads to both mixing and matching the two aesthetics without really understanding the differences between Synthwave and Vaporwave. Various socialist tendencies depict opposing ideologies and leaders in Laborwave, with the dominant ideology in the community being Marxism-Leninism since it is less prevalent in the libertarian socialist and anarchist communities (who will typically just get into Vaporwave).  It should be noted that Laborwave has absolutely no connection to Sovietwave whatsoever, which is mainly a nostalgic look at Soviet-era Russia but otherwise has no political leanings either way.
