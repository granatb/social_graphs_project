Dragoncore is an aesthetic that rose to relevance together with other more mythical and nature-related aesthetics, during the 2010s. It is seen as an direct foil to Goblincore and Crowcore due to its values of appreciating and collecting shiny, beautiful trinkets like jewels, coins and various gemstones, but it can also be collecting things of sentimental value to the user. The difference to the other two aesthetics lies in the hoard. Where goblins collect ugly and crows collect trivial things, a dragon collects "worthy" treasures.
