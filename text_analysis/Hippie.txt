Hippie (sometimes spelled as 'hippy') is a member of the counterculture of the 1960s, originally a youth movement that began in the United States and spread to other countries around the world. The word 'hippie' came from the word 'hipster' and was used to describe beatniks who moved into New York City's Greenwich Village and San Francisco's Haight-Ashbury district. While it faded out of fashion in the 1970s, it has enjoyed occasional blips of popularity since the 1990s.
