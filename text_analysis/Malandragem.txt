"Agostinho Carrara", from the hit series "A Grande Família". 		 	 Malandragem is a Brazilian term for a lifestyle of idleness, fast living and petty crime – traditionally celebrated in Samba lyrics, especially those of Noel Rosa and Bezerra da Silva. The exponent of this lifestyle, the malandro (masculine adjective), or "bad boy" (rogue, hustler, rascal, scoundrel, gangster), has become significant to Brazilian national identity as a folk hero or, rather, an anti-hero.This lifestyle can be seen portrayed in the character "Agostinho Carrara", from the Brazilian tv show "A Grande Família". Furthermore, Malandragem is the central theme in a song by the same name, from the Brazilian singer Cássia Eller. One of the oldest symbols of Malandragem in Brazilian media is the character Jose "Zé" Carioca, an anthropomorphic  parrot created by Disney in the 1940s for their animated films Saludos Amigos and The Three Caballeros to depict the typical Malandro Carioca (a person resident in the state of Rio de Janeiro).
