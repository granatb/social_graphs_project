Pixiecore is an aesthetic that is derived from a blend of Fairycore and Goblincore. Pixiecore is similar to both, but unlike Fairycore, fashion usually involves more tunics and t-shirts and not as many pastels. And unlike Goblincore, it does not involve "dirty" things such as insects and dirt. Pixiecore is very loving of nature, but focuses more on indoor gardening such as succulents, cacti and terrariums.In folklore, pixies love to play in water, and as such, pixiecore also focuses on things such as bathing in baths filled with things such as bubbles, soap petals and bath bombs.Similar to Crowcore and Goblincore, Pixiecore involves the culture of collecting things from the floor and keeping them. Pixiecore also focuses on rainbow tones, anything holographic, iridescent, or rainbow coloured can be involved in the aesthetic.
