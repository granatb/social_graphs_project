Forestpunk is an aesthetic that is in the naturecore family. It is similar to cottagecore in its high regard for nature and mutual support. However, forestpunk is less restrictive of technology, particularly solar-powered items.      Forestpunk also diverges from other related aesthetics in its inspiration & timeframe. Where Cottagecore is derived from a romanticization of a European rural lifestyle, forestpunk-like styles have and still are present in several cultures around the world. (Examples include the Nordic, Uralic, Roma, Celtic, Siberian, Austronesian, Subsaharan, Aborigine, and Native American peoples.)As long as there's a forest element to it, you've spotted a good inspiration, be it clothing or farming. While the examples mentioned earlier are good guides, take a look at the image on the right for more modern inspiration.For example, a cabin in the middle of the woods, surrounded by vines & trees, living off rainwater & produce, feeding toads & deer while collecting their bones for decoration. Or, an apartment with solar panels with plants dotting the walls, rocks & buttermoths moving around, buying locally & dressed in greens & light browns. Goals are not only flexible, but each person makes their own based on acting feral and surviving in the wild.There is some overlap with Cryptidcore due to the more feral nature of the aesthetic, Mosscore for obvious reasons, and Goblincore due to the recollection of mosses, rocks, and plants used for decoration (in non-harmful ways to the environment) being a widespread practice.
