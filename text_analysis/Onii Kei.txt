Onii Kei (literal 'elder brother style') is a Japanese fashion style that combines American casual, Italian casual, and rocker styles to create a 'slick' look. White tailored jackets, low-necked tank tops, imported jeans, and pointed shoes are commonly featured. A shag haircut known as 'wolf hair' is also a part of this fashion style. Onii Kei is the male counterpart of Onee Kei (literal 'elder sister style'), which emerged around 1996 and was a sexy, casual style which featured body-hugging dresses and an adult look.
