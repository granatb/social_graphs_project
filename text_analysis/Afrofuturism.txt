Afrofuturism is an aesthetic centered around an Afrocentric view of the future (it shares some similarity to Solarpunk [which is something of a misnomer itself since Solarpunk is a less dystopian worldview compared to Cyberpunk]) and buys into the philosophy that the future is black. Afrofuturism is one of the rare aesthetics that can encompass the visual medium, fashion, the written word, and music, and tackles themes such as feminism, alienation from your people, the grotesque, water symbolism, and reclamation of one's identity through their roots. Probably the most popular example of Afrofuturism in popular culture right now is Black Panther. Afrofuturist thought is probably what inspired the initial push for the Art Hoe movement.
