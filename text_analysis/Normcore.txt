In fashion, Normcore is a trend characterized by unpretentious, average-looking clothing. "Normcore" is a portmanteau of the words "normal" and "hardcore". The word first appeared in webcomic Templar, Arizona before 2009 and was later employed by K-Hole, a trend forecasting group, in an October 2013 report called "Youth Mode: A Report on Freedom".As used by K-Hole, "normcore" refers to an attitude, not a particular code of dress. It was intended to mean "finding liberation in being nothing special." However, an influential February 2014 piece in New York magazine conflated it with what K-Hole terms "Acting Basic", a concept under which dressing neutrally is a means to avoiding standing out. This broader sense of "normcore" as referring to understated and noncommittal attitudes to fashion gained popular usage. At the same time, many cultural references that are tied to broadly neutral fashion aesthetics, such as the characters featured on the television series Seinfeld, also exemplify to a significant extent the ethos of normcore in the more radical sense proposed by K-Hole.
