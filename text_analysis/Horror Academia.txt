Horror Academia is a subgenre of academia that focuses thematically on the overwhelming amount of knowledge in the world. Visually, it takes horror—especially cosmic or Lovecraftian horror—and applies it to academia, research, and learning. It takes inspiration from the exhaustion of being a student or researcher, the fear of failure, and the fear of the unknown, focusing specifically on cramped, dingy spaces, like libraries or archives, and leaning away from the more elegant gothic motifs that characterize Dark Academia or Darkest Academia. Horror academia is a dreary, depressing aesthetic that reflects the difficulty and laborious workload of real academia, made manifest in the spooky, grimdark, and monstrous horror ambience of the aesthetic.
