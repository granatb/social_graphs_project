Bimbo casual is an aesthetic associated with self-identified (typically queer) bimbos. In this context, a "bimbo" is defined as a kind, body-positive, sex-positive, woman or woman aligned person. This aesthetic is centered around warm/funky colours, a blending of feminine style with androgynous and masculine accents, and an embracing of one's sex appeal.
