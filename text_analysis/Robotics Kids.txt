Robotics kids are the high school aged people who compete in a program called First Robotics Competition or something similar. Robotics kids usually flock together with other robotics kids as normal humans view their obsession with any and all things robotics annoying at times. Most dedicate themselves to robotics to the point of physical detriment and when warned of the consequences will defend these actions with the phrase "but its build season".There are many meme pages specifically for robotics kids to appeal to the warped sense of humor they have obtained through years or robotics. All true robotics kids share a unique obsession with Woodie Flowers or Dean Kamen. Robotics kids view the freshman in the group as the underlings or robotics children until they can be raised into the subdivision of their choosing (mechanical, electrical, drive team, marketing, programming, etc) and lovingly roast them at every opportunity. Robotics kids share the values of Gracious Professionalism and all aspire for the day their team can win the coveted Blue Banner.
