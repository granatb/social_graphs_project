Queencore is a more mature, regal variant of Princesscore and a subgenre of Royalcore.Queencore may consist of more adult-like themes, like politics and war, so it is assumed to be more heavy-handed than Princesscore. Inspiration can be drawn from matriarchal figures in hierarchy-centered shows and movies, especially those centered around kingdoms.Queencore aesthetics show through strength and guidance, skill and patience. Those who adopt a Queencore aesthetic may be seen as the leader of a group. They hold themselves to higher standards, as a way to show worthiness of their title and position. The Queencore aesthetic wouldn't be complete without confidence and displays of good leadership.For a darker approach, colors can be toned deeper, and inspiration can be drawn from evil queen characters. This aesthetic can be great inspiration for modern styles.
