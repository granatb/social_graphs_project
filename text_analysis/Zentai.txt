Zentai is a type of fashion that is a skin-tight garment that covers the entire body, they come in many styles, colors, and designs.  Originating in Japan, this form-fitting outfit has been used around the world for a variety of activities; marketing/advertising, film, sporting events, street dancing, and performance art (just to name a few).  Despite this, there are places where it is outright illegal to wear a zentai; in France, for example, you can be fined up to â‚¬150 for wearing one in public, and some sporting leagues (most notably Major League Baseball) outright ban the usage of zentai hoods/masks.
