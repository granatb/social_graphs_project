Warning: Milleniwave visuals do have the potential to trigger seizures due to flashing, bright, and/or obnoxious colors and lights. Viewer discretion is advised.Milleniwave is an aesthetic born from an overall sense of Millennial frustration and existential dread with the direction society is going by trying to put a happy face and a bright, colorful facade over it that does a piss-poor job of actually hiding it.  While most modern aesthetics stem from a desire to completely retreat from the seeming-downward spiral society is currently on, Milleniwave completely embraces that things suck right now. But, they donâ€™t have to remain sucking, and that we can all rebound from the current societal gunk and ride crescent fresh into new era inspired by the futures that never were. This aesthetic is a better way to facilitate change by present an alternative.
