Cyberpop is primarily a fashion aesthetic with roots in Cybergoth and Raver. The style features cyberfalls, neon colored hairstyles, and partially shaved hairstyles. The form of clothing follows the conventions found in cybergoth, but all black and grunge elements are removed. It's apt to say that cyberpop is the child of cybergoth and kandi kid aesthetic styles.
