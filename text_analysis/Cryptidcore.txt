Cryptidcore is traditionally associated with cryptozoology, or the study of creatures from urban legends and folklore, and the glorification and idolization of cryptids, conspiracies, and all-around mystery. Cryptidcore is also, generally vintage, and takes visual inspiration, especially with regards to fashion, from the 1970s - 90s. Another aspect of cryptidcore is the romanticization of cryptids. Phrases like "Mothman is real, I'm married to him" are common in cryptidcore circles.
