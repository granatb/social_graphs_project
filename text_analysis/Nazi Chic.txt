''Please note that this page exists for the purposes of documentation, not promotion. Due to the role the Nazi Party played in history and the subsequent sensitive and offensive nature of this aesthetic, it is not recommended that you adopt it for yourself. Aesthetics Wiki does not endorse Nazi ideology - but it is important to acknowledge its impact on modern culture.''Nazi Chic is an aesthetic centered around the use of Nazi-era style, imagery, and paraphernalia in clothing and popular culture, especially when used for taboo-breaking or shock value rather than out of genuine sympathies with Nazism or Nazi ideology, although it can be used as a tool to critique elements of contemporary society by drawing allusions to the Nazi Party and their laundry list of evils they committed.A popular use of the Nazi Chic aesthetic occured in the mid-1970s with the emergence of the Punk movement in London: the Sex Pistols' first television appearance occurred with a person of their entourage wearing a swastika.  This was, however, done as an attempt to shock and offend the status quo rather than showing any sympathies towards the Nazi party as the Punk subculture had a strongly left-wing bent to their ideology with many adherents adopting more of an anarchist philosophy (which makes the claims of "Conservatism being the new Punk Rock" entirely laughable, considering Punk always had left-wing ties).
