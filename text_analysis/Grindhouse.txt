Grindhouse is an aesthetic originating in the 1970s involving the poor living conditions of ghettoes, cheap, low-budget genre films, and decaying urban sprawl. The name is derived from lower-class cinemas, or Grindhouses, which would produce and screen films which today escape the public eye. The term was made popular by Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez with their 2007 collaborative double feature, Grindhouse, which attempts to capture the essence of sitting in a Grindhouse movie theater, complete with previews and interludes.
