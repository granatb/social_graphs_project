This is a sensitive topic and the controversy is discussed in depth at the bottom of the article. Many would argue that buying into this aesthetic and subculture is not far from a romanticization of pedophilia. Please research the implications of this style thoroughly before making the decision to involve yourself in it. If this makes you incredibly uncomfortable but you do like the look, you can still be a part of the Babygirl community and frown upon people in the community who do romanticize pedophilia.It's still necessary to acknowledge even harmful influences on modern visual culture, but we at the Aesthetics Wiki DO NOT condone the romanticization of pedophilia. Continue at your own risk.Babygirl is an aesthetic taken from the BDSM subgenre of the same name. Babygirl encompasses sweet and innocent imagery and attitudes that give the adult wearer an overall childlike feel. The Babygirl aesthetic can vary from Babycore to Baddie to E-Girl or Pastel Goth. Often this can cross over with bratty attitudes and behavior; this means the sweet and submissive nature can morph into teasing, pouting, tantrums, entitlement, and a compulsion to challenge others. These childish themes allow the person to release typical adult stressors and fall into a more easy and comfortable state of mind as a stress relief technique sometimes known as age regression. Although, this aspect in its depth is not required or utilized by all in the community and is reliant on individual preference. The main purpose of this aesthetic, seperate from the sexualized sect, is to allow adults to feel and reclaim childhood wonderment and comfort, and to also overcome obstacles from abuse (similar to Traumacore's purpose) and heal while still maintaining a more matured sense of style and dignity. Be advised when searching terms related to this aesthetic as the results will show explicit content aimed at adults 18+.
