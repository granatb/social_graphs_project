Selkiecore is based around the mythological selkies, seals, Norse and Celtic/norse marine life as well as their environment, including the usual grey cold weather and look of their environment. Though selkies are a big part of the aesthetic, it also covers Celtic and norse marine life in general. The nature aspect features rocky beaches, rocky shorelines, rocky coastlines, the cold ocean itself, cold weather, grey lighting, cloudy skies, and even foggy and misty waters as well.  The setting is usually Ireland, Scotland, as well as Scandinavian and Norse countries like Norway, Sweden, Finland. Harbors, coastal towns and lighthouses as part of this aesthetic as well provided they feature gray cloudy skies, or cold dark waters. The aesthetic is similar to Mermaidcore, but less colorful and flashy, as it favors cooler, darker and neutral colors. While Nautical centers on the sailormen or fishermen, the sea itself, and sea towns they live on, as well as fish, nets, ships and things like that. This is unlike selkiecore, which centers on mythological sea creatures as well as other marine life, their nature and their habitat. The aesthetic also has a Norse/Celtic touch because of the myth that selkies are from and the environment of the other marine life.
