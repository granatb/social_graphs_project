Romantic Academia is an academic aesthetic specializing in love, romance literature, and the Romantic era. Romantic Academia is visually and philosophically similar to Light Academia. However, Romantic Academia includes more visuals associated with romantic love and lust, the latter of which is generally excluded from Light Academia. Philosophically, both aesthetics value education, curiosity, compassion, and optimism, but Romantic Academia differs from Light Academia in its focus on individualism, appreciation of nature, and aesthetic expression of intense and sometimes negative emotions. Like both Dark and Light Academia, Romantic Academia relies heavily on visuals, philosophy, and literature with origins in Western Europe.
