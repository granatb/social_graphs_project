La Sape (also known as The Society of Ambianceurs and Elegant People) is a subculture centered on the cities of Kinshasa and Brazzaville in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Republic of Congo respectively. The name comes from the French slang word sape, which means "clothes" or "dressed up." La Sape aims to show elegance and style within fashion, similar to predecessors before. People who participate in the movement are called sapeurs.
