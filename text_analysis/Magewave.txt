Magewave is an aesthetic associated with the classic ideal of the wizard. It shouldn't be confused with Wizardcore or Witchcore, as it rejects the muted imagery and Cottagecore stylings associated with those aesthetics. Magewave imagery is bright and fantastical; the cabalistic gibbering of a withered greybeard, palms erupting with primordial, elemental force -- oh! A warlock, pointed hat raised high to the heavens, siphoning the raw energy of the ley line for a ritual.
