Cyber minimalism is characterized by sleek, smooth, simplistic, and organized technological design and function. The user interfaces are ideally created with multiple accessibility functions to aid user experience, such as easily readable fonts, high contrast/dark mode options, and rounded shapes to reduce visual load. Many websites, software, and electronics by corporations in the late 2010s to 2020s have these elements, such as Google, Discord, Twitter, Apple, etc. Cyber minimalism is slightly inspired by Android societal elements in the video game Detroit: Become Human.It is not necessarily futuristic or utopian, such as in Cyberprep, but it can be. It also doesn't have to be tied to corporatism or businesses. The primary focus is the minimal distraction, ease of access, and streamlined processes of technology.
