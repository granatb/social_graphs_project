Kinderwhore was a clothing style worn by a handful of mostly female grunge bands in the US during the early to mid-1990s.The exact origin of the clothing style is uncertain. It is believed that Kat Bjelland from the band Babes in Toyland was the first to wear and define the look, while her former roommate Courtney Love from the band HOLE was the first to popularize it.Courtney Love, who popularized kinderwhore, commented in 1994 that 'I would like to think—in my heart of hearts—that I'm changing some psychosexual aspects of rock music. Not that I'm so desirable. I didn't do the kinder-whore thing because I thought I was so hot. When I see the look used to make one more appealing, it pisses me off. When I started, it was a What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? thing. My angle was irony.'The name 'Kinderwhore' was coined by melody maker journalist Everett True in an interview with Kurt Cobain and Courtney Love (1993). The term was mostly used by the media and less by the musicians themselves.  A often mentioned inspiration for the style are the musicians Kim Shattuck of the band The Muffs, Christine Amphlett of the band Divinyls or Katie Jane Garside of the band Daisy Chainsaw. The kinderwhore-fashion  became a source of inspiration for many designers such as Hedi Slimane, Batsheva Hay and even Marc Jacobs. In 2019, Batsheva Hay named Courtney Love's “kinderwhore aesthetic” as a big inspiration.  Hay said the look was "so of it's time, but also so ahead of it's time".
