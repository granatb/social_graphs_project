Hikecore is a way of dressing that emphasizes utilitarian garments that impart comfort, waterproofing and wind-proofing, such as those would wear on a long walk. It also involves hiking as well. Hikecore relies on appreciation for nature and hiking. Those who belong to the hikecore aesthetic are generally accepting of all things natural and encourage a healthy relationship with the world around them. They enjoy casual/practical clothing with a whimsical outdoorsy touch. This is very similar to adventurecore, but hikecore takes place in purely forests and campgrounds. Adventurecore can take place in jungles and various other places. Hikecore can be considered to be a type of adventurecore, but they are not the same.
