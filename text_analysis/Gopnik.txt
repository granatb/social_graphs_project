Disclaimer: It has come to recent attention that some Slavic people are uncomfortable with non-Slavic people adopting this aesthetic. As such, it's a good idea to be respectful of Slavic culture if you plan to seriously adopt it into your life. If you are Slavic, feel free to critically discuss Gopnik in the comments (but do be civil aswell!). Gopnik is a fashion aesthetic that involves wearing clothing of the Gopnik, a member of a subculture in Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and other former Soviet republics. Since the fashion was established after the fall of the USSR, the Gopnik style was influenced by lower-income citizens at the time.
