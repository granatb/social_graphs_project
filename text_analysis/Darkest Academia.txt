Darkest Academia (also known as Gothic Academia) is an academic aesthetic. It encompasses the Academia aesthetic (classic literature, the pursuit of self-discovery, and a general passion for knowledge and learning), but with more serious and mature themes (unlike Romantic Academia). It takes what Dark Academia is about and turns it up to 11, incorporating gothic studies, literature, poetry, arts, architecture, music, and general Gothic related topics. It is related to finding beauty within the darkest places.
