Comfy/Cozy is an aesthetic that relates to the feeling of being comfortably at rest with your surroundings, neatly fit in your place, relieved and well-suited. It includes having pets, reading books, and sitting next to a fireplace or window, or on a bed. Usually associated with Autumn and pumpkin spices, and with swift movements instead of challenges. Others also include reading, sleeping, watching movies or just doing nothing whilst at ease and petting your dog/cat.Specific themes associated are messy beds as the symbolize one's unwillingness to wake up, and dreams (either be asleep or wish to). While the aesthetic is not as predominant on the several social media sites out there yet, such as Instagram, TikTok, and others, the community notably began and prospered on Tumblr.It should be noted that this aesthetic sometimes is confused with Light Academia due to similar color palette and some key values. However, one main difference between the two is that Light Academia(and all aesthetics with the Academia suffix, for that matter) is that it is focused on learning, studying, and a thirst for knowledge. Comfy/Cozy's main idea is being comfortable, relaxed, and happy.
