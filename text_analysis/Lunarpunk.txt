Lunarpunk is a more tentative aesthetic, existing as a lesser-defined genre when compared to others. It is regarded as the sibling aesthetic of Solarpunk. Lunarpunk, to its more universal properties, references witchcraft, futuristic design, nature, renewable energy, and the circle of life. These worlds focus on introverted details of oneself and/or the environmental setting rather than a greater community or singular "one." As Tumblr user solarisrebellio words it, "...you would be more likely to see small sects of persons worshipping (or devoting to) The Self rather than The Other.""Lunar," in the context of this aesthetic, references the moon, its cycles, phases, and activities, and by extension, lunar witchcraft, the sea, and the night. "Punk" intends to reference both the futuristic setting of a Lunarpunk society as well as the struggle against a more suspicious, mysterious government/overruling power. Visuals of the aesthetic are borrowed from pagan, satanic, Wiccan, or anarchist references, and the architecture is a mixture of futuristic shapes as well as mushroom-inspired, luminescent, nature-based designs.  In symbolism and tarot, the moon represents things such as illusion, subconscious, higher self, emotions, and change.
