Christian girl autumn is an over-the-top, specific version of the Autumn aesthetic. It features many elements of the Autumn aesthetic and is often associated with basic white girls. For fashion, a typical Christian Girl Autumn outfit could include a thin sweater, skinny jeans, a big chunky scarf and UGG boots. Hair is usually worn down and wavy, and makeup is moderate. Activities that girls in this aesthetic take part in are ordering pumpkin spice drinks at Starbucks, watching the leaves fall with their boyfriends, picking pumpkins and others.
