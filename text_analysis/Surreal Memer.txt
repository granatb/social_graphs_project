Surreal Memers are people who post or consume a subgenre of ironic memes called surreal memes. These memes are usually bizarre or absurd, with the punchline frequently being the obvious lack thereof. The humor displayed in a Surreal meme is often intentionally meaningless and self-aware, reflecting the style of humor Gen Z is commonly known for.
