Princecore is a subgenre of Royalcore and a more masculine variant of Princesscore. Princecore is heavily based on gay relationships. Most of its popularity is on Tumblr. A majority of Princecore writing is heavily centered around fictional gay prompts centering relationships between princes and knights, or other princes. Though less common, fictional relationships between princes and female knights also make up a part of the Princecore aesthetic. There are generally two sides of Princecore, one being elegant and mature, the other slightly more childish and young with fantastical aspects.
