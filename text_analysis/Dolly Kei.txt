Dolly Kei (Japanese: アンティーク, meaning "antique") is a Japanese fashion style that was influenced by European clothing and antique dolls; fairy tales, Romani culture, and peasants from the Middle Ages were also influential. While Grimoire, a shop, was influential in the creation of Dolly Kei, Dolly Kei itself is not very brand focused.
