The Art Hoe aesthetic is an aesthetic based around a love for art, a connection to nature, painting, and flowers. Created by a Tumblr user known as sensitiveblackperson, the Art Hoe scene was created for POC (people of color) and has been accused of being whitewashed. But the Art Hoe community claims to celebrate diversity. Famous original Art Hoes include actress Amandla Stenberg, stylist Rian Phin, illustrator/musician Jenelle Lewis, and rapper Babeo Baggins.
