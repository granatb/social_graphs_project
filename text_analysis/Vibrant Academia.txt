Vibrant Academia is an academic aesthetic similar in theme and style to Light Academia and Pastel Academia but with brighter hues. It is unusual with the Academia aesthetic genre as it is not as subdued in colour. Vibrant academia focuses on the joy of learning and the pursuit of knowledge out of curiosity. There is a particular focus on mental health, wellness, and taking care of your mind that is not typically present in other academic aesthetic. It encourages open and frank discussions of serious mental health disorders and tries to break down stigma.There is also an element of teaching and the enjoyment of passing on your knowledge as well as increasing it through study. Think of your batty science professor, nutty art teacher, kooky literature lecturer. Clothing involves the traditional academia motifs, vintage styles (the 50s lends itself well to this subtype due to the more vibrant colouring) waistcoats, berets, tweed, shirts and blouses, cardigans (bonus points for elbow pads), but in brighter hues. There is a love for big, kitschy costume jewellery.Areas of study can include many topics but literature, art, and psychology as well as other sciences are particular themes.Vibrant Academia intentionally celebrates all learning and all academics, regardless of subject, grades, degree level, educational institute, or background (including class, race, sex, (dis)ability, religion, gender and gender identity, sexuality, etc.).
