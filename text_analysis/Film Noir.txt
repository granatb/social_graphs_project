This page is under construction. Film noir is a genre of crime film that was popularized from the 1940s to the 1950s. Its cynical characters, stark lighting, and existential philosophy are hallmarks of the style. The tropes often came about from the rise of "hard-boiled" crime fiction from the Great Depression, with the familiar tropes of urbanism, fast-paced slang, sex, and violence came into print, which contrasts the previous decade's country house mystery.
