After Hours is an aesthetic inspired by the feelings and impressions of seeing a usually populated setting empty. After Hours isnâ€™t defined in terms of media, but instead, the feelings that can emit from being at these places in person. Places that can come under this aesthetic are not limited to physical places. Places online such as abandoned blogs, empty game servers, and inactive websites can elicit similar feelings.The most important aspect of After Hours is tranquility. This is the biggest difference between After Hours and the adjacent aesthetic, Liminal Space, which is intentionally designed to be unsettling.Several people with this aesthetic have a small group of friends or prefer to be on their own. These types of people love silence and quiet settings. Being away from everyone and everything is comforting to them.
