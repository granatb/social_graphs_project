Bardcore (also known as Tavernwave) is a music genre that arranges modern pop-songs such as "What is Love", "Pumped up Kicks" or "Astronomia" to sound medieval and "old-timey". Some of the songs also feature rewritten versions of the original lyrics, using archaism to make them sound more authentically medieval.
