Scoutcore is an aesthetic surrounded by scoutism activities, such as camps and closely related to Campcore. Activities such as campfire songs, games, bonding activities (e.g, braiding hair, hiking), bead crafts,earning patches and the euphoria of summer make up this aesthetic. Scoutcore isn't mainly focused on girl or boy scouts, mostly having fun, camp morals, bunkmates, collecting badges and summer activites. Sometimes, even a level of clich√© camp romance. Scoutism was created in 1907 by Robert Baden Powell on the Brownsea Island in United Kingdom.
