Warning: This page contains mature content, such as swearing.  Bubblegum Bitch is characterized by bright colors, especially pink, and to a lesser extent purple and white, which combines feminine and childlike aspects of fashion with teenage and adult self-expression. Bubblegum Bitch was strongly influenced by 2000s American pop culture, and takes some visual and philosophical inspiration from McBling.  A point of confusion is parody artwork and clothing featuring cartoon characters like Hello Kitty or Barbie but using swear words or referencing sex. Because of this, these things are not technically Sanriocore or Barbiecore, but in fact Bubblegum Bitch.
