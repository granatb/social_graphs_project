Anglo Gothic is an aesthetic based on the atmosphere of dingy suburban English areas with an emphasis on overcast skies, drizzling rain, council estates, grime, the colour blue, and melancholy. Works that fall under this category tend to explore the themes of class, industrialism, and feature English staples such as cheap tea and biscuits. Other common themes are the hardships of labour occupations such as coal or steel mining and factory work that are common among those in the working class in England. A lot of Anglo Gothic media is influenced by the boom in council estates being built in the 1960s in England, hence a lot of imagery being evocative of that time.
