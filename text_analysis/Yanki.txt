They are famous for being loud, rude and refusing to take part in the strict manners of Japanese society.This subculture flourished in Japan in the '80s and '90s. Yankii could be recognized by punch perms or pompadours, shaved eyebrows, altered school uniforms, popping squats, being poor students and causing violence or trouble.  Yankii is a term that applies to both boys and girls. Although it is rumored that yankii would be recruited into the yakuza (the Japanese mafia), this is not always true. Many yankii simply joined the regular workforce and lived regular, productive lives after high school.The name "yankii" (ヤンキー) is borrowed from the English word "Yankee", a name taken from the American GIs who gave the Japanese their first glimpse into the world of rock ‘n’ roll.
