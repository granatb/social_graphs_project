Frutiger Aero is an aesthetic that was prevalent from roughly 2004 to 2012. Frutiger Aero is characterized by its use of skeuomorphism, glossy textures, use of nature and humanism, use of bright and vibrant colours (usually contrasted on a white or monochrome background), and use of glass. This aesthetic was used in the technology and visual design of the time, and is often associated with the early days of Web 2.0.Frutiger Aero is similar to the Y2K aesthetic and can be considered its successor, as it shares a similar bright and glossy futuristic look. Frutiger Aero was also concurrent with the McBling & Surf Crush aesthetic, and overlaps with them in some respects. By 2012â€“13, the skeuomorphic look of Frutiger Aero (i.e. iOS 6, Windows 7) had started to fade in favor of the Cyber Minimalism/Blob Web look (i.e. iOS 7, Windows 8).
