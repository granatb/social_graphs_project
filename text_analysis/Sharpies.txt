Sharpies, (or Sharps, not to be confused with SHARP (Skinheads Against Racial Prejudice)) were members of suburban youth gangs in Australia, most significantly from the 1960s and 1970s. They were particularly prominent in Melbourne, but were also found in Sydney and Perth to lesser extents. Like skinheads, sharpies were frustrated and rebellious youth, often from working-class homes, and gang violence was part of the lifestyle. Sharpie gangs were frequently named after the suburb or street the gang members came from. Gangs were very territorial and fought between themselves, or against local surfers. However, it is unclear exactly how much fighting actually happened. Despite its distinctive aesthetic, the Sharpie style was short-lived, and therefore poorly documented.
