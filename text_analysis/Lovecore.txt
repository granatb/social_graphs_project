Lovecore is based on the visual culture of manufactured romance and affection. Popular motifs include hearts, boxes of chocolate, lipstick, love letters, cupid, angels, and the colours red and pink. There are also at times vintage elements present in the form of scans of Valentines Day cards written in the 1950s and 60s. There is sometimes overlap with anime in the form of pink manga edits and images of anime characters with hearts in their eyes.As the aesthetic became more intense and anime-centric, a subcategory of lovecore called Yandere appeared. Lovecore tends to focus on the commercialization of love through Valentine's Day and marketing as well as wholesome celebration of love rather than the dark, macabre or erotic. Lovecore originated on Tumblr.
