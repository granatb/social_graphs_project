This page needs work.Shamate (Shā mǎ tè/杀马特) is an edgy aesthetic that comes from China. Very similar to Emo and Scene subcultures or Japan's Visual Kei, Shamate involves spiking one's hair and dying it unnatural colors, dark makeup focusing on the eyes and lips, and shocking/statement-making accessories such as religious symbols, dog collars, or anything representing death and darkness.
