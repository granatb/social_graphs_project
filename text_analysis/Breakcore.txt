Breakcore is a genre of music born from a mixture of hardcore, gabber, IDM, jungle, digital hardcore, hardcore punk, grindcore, and industrial. Breakcore is characterized by the usage of heavy kick drums, deep bass, odd time signatures, "scattered breaks" put in a random rhythmic fashion, and samples of popular songs to classical music played at high tempos (180-190 BPM).
