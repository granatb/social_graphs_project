Content warning: mentions of alcohol, smoking, and sex.Flappers were young Western women in the 1920s who embraced a free lifestyle. They were known for their short skirts (here meaning knee-length) and shoulder-length hair. They also listened to jazz. Smoking, drinking, driving automobiles, and casual sex were another part of Flappers. Essentially, Flappers made their disdain for socially-acceptable female behavior known.
