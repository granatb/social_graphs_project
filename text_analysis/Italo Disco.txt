Italo disco is a music subgenre that formed in Italy during the 70s and 80s. It spawned from the evolutions of electronic dance music in the Western world, taking influence from pop, electronica and dance, as well as other subgenres such as hi-NRG, Eurobeat and space disco. Italo Disco is sonically and aesthetically retro, as it does take from disco. Italo Disco's influence carried on to genres such as synth-pop and new wave.
