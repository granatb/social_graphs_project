This page needs work.Powwow Step, or Electric Pow Wow, is a fusion of Native American and First Nations iconography and music with modern electronica and dance club fashions. A pow wow (sometimes spelled "powwow" or "pow wow") is a large public or private social gathering held by many different Native American communities, which typically incorporates traditional foods, dancing, regalia, jewelry, and music. The genre takes its name from a song of the same name released by the Canadian electronic music group A Tribe Called Red in 2011.
