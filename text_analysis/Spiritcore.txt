Spiritcore is an aesthetic primarily based around the feeling of supernatural or out of this world happenings at night. It is often associated with a feeling of loneliness, but this is not necessarily a bad thing. It is similar to Lo-Fi aesthetic, in the sense of colour palette and general setting but more strongly associates with Lunarpunk as it has a strong feel of magic and fictitious happenings.
