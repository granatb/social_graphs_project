Cripplepunk (also known as cpunk, crippunk, or cr*pple punk) is an aesthetic and a movement that focuses on disability pride, primarily for physical disabilities. Cripplepunk involves accepting and loving oneself for, not despite of, disabilities, mobility aids, and the struggles that come with them. It also rejects the myth of disabled people as "inspirational" heroes simply because they have a disability, and that they have to be perfectly nice and submissive to be respected by able-bodied people. Many people involved in Cripplepunk bond over their struggles, being treated as lesser by able-bodied people, and the ableism in the medical industry and society as a whole. Cripplepunk is for physically disabled people specifically.
