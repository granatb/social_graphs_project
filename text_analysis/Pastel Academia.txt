Pastel Academia is one of the many variations of the Academia aesthetic and subculture. It revolves around the ideals of having a passion for learning and studying, specifically the arts and literature. Someone who is a part of the Pastel Academia aesthetic is less mature and more child-like than those who identify with the other versions of academia. They enjoy venturing and have an overall upbeat and positive outlook on life, juxtaposing its less optimistic variations. Unlike its more well-known variations, Pastel Academia visually stems from a mixture of East Asian (mainly Japanese) and European cultures.
