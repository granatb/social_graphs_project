Urbancore is an aesthetic based on imagery of urban cities and street life. Urbancore is associated to real-life, modern-day society and almost always is based in recent decades.  It can revolve around city streets, graffiti, skate parks at night, and picnics. Similar to High School Dream, this aesthetic embodies a youthful and somewhat rebellious spirit of a teen living in a nostalgic time.
