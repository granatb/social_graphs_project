The Chav is a phrase that describes an often working-class individuals perceived as anti-social or uncouth.  Chavs generally come from a working-to-lower-class background (predominant in Northern England) and tend to adopt a lot of the aesthetic choices and attitudes often associated with wealthy African-American communities (expensive jewellry, designer clothes, etc).  The female equivalent is often referred to as a "Chavette". The chav has multiple outlets to be able to get on TV other than Geordie Shore, such as The Jeremy Kyle Show (think of it like a English Jerry Springer) despite that show being cancelled in May 2019.  However, references to chavs have been made in more popular English television shows, such as The Catherine Tate Show, Little Britain and Doctor Who. Although often used as a label for anyone perceived as loutish, violent and anti-social, it is also very frequently used as a classist term in England used to discriminate against white people in the North of England and the working class. The term 'chav' is widely used and has gained awareness internationally recently through TikTok. It is sometimes rumoured to be an acronym for 'Council Housed and Violent', however this is not entirely accurate. The term comes with a lot of problems about the class divide in England, a centuries long issue that still continues very severely to this day.
