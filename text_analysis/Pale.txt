Pale or Pale Aesthetic is an aesthetic based on simple photos with a color palette based on white, grey, black, green, and blue. Appeared on Tumblr between 2014 and 2015. Some photos are intended to be sad looking, of someone suffering for love or with a '90s vibe, for example.Despite calling themselves grunge, their aesthetic was fairly popular in the mainstream and connected to the rise of the Alternative, emo, pop, and indie music and fashion trends of the time, such as galaxy print, black and white grids, and fandom merchandise. Because of their close-knit community on tumblr, they developed a "not-like-other-girls" attitude, especially in contrast with the "hipsters" (which is more accurately described as an early version of VSCO). The type of media they consumed was also incredibly specific, with fangirl culture and this aesthetic often overlapping. This style later declined, yet has gained short-term popularity in 2020 due to a desire to escape to the past.
