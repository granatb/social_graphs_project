Warning: This page discusses mental health and other sensitive topics. If talks of blood, mental illness, or abusive relationships disturb you, tread lightly on this page and if you feel any sort of mental health problems are consuming you, please get in touch with a mental health professional and get whatever help you need. Thank you.Yandere (ヤンデレ), derived from the Japanese words yanderu (to be sick) and dererere (to love), describes a character archetype with an unhealthy love-related obsession that often results in violent outbreaks triggered by unrequited love or disappointment. Another similar type of character would be Yangire, who turns violent regardless of love.Due to the controversial nature of Yandere as a trope in anime, often criticized of fetishizing or demonizing the mentally ill as well as romanticizing abuse, this aesthetic had to become distinct from the more wholesome Lovecore on a level beyond their aesthetic differences. Many mentally ill people choose to indulge in Yandere to find like-minded others and reclaim the concept as a form of coping mechanism.
