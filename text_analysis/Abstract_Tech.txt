The Abstract Tech aesthetic consists of design motifs, such as concentric arcs, hexagons, or circuit patterns, that are intended to evoke a sense of something being futuristic or technologically advanced. This aesthetic can be found in user interfaces, depictions of cyberspace, and other technological imagery in science fiction media of the Digital Age, such as the interfaces from Minority Report (2002) and Iron Man (2008), or the video game TRON 2.0 (2003) and the film TRON: Legacy (2010), as well as stock images and backgrounds/wallpapers related to keywords like "technology," "high-tech," "digital," or "cyber."
