Casino is an aesthetic that is based around the theme of casinos, gambling and coin games.Casinos are designed to create a pleasant atmosphere to reduce stress and convey a "playground" environment, thus encouraging patrons to spend more money.In some ways, Casino can be paired very well with both Cartelcore and Stripcore, since all three cater to "deadly" vices (Cartelcore caters to greed, gluttony, and sometimes wrath, Stripcore to lust, and Casino purely to greed).
