Softie is a group of aesthetics dedicated to going for as cutesy of a look as possible, putting it in a trifecta of aesthetics, alongside VSCO and E-People. It draws a lot of parallels with some of the Kawaii-centric aesthetics in Japan, but with a more subdued look compared to how over-the-top some of the looks in Japan tend to get.They are sometimes mistaken for preppies. Note: You may go by just "Softie" or "Softkid" (since Softie is a group of aesthetics) if you are non-binary or want a gender-neutral title.
