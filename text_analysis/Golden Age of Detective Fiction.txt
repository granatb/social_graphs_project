The Golden Age of Detective Fiction is the period of mystery fiction set in the 1920s-1930s. The plots revolve around upper class characters and murder. It centers around the dichotomy between the elegance of the European elite and the savagery and blood that comes with the events of the story. Feelings of suspense, interesting characters with different backgrounds, and glamorous settings are major components of this aesthetic.
