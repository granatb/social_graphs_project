Hydrogen is an aesthetic designed to evoke a vibe of a combination of calmness, a feeling of being static or frozen in time, and enough strangeness to feel slightly surreal. Common elements of Hydrogen, like lunar imagery and retrofuturism, are simply effective ways to evoke these three emotions. In the 1930s, gaseous hydrogen was used in zeppelins to make them float; this feeling of slow, retro-futuristic lighter-than-air-ness is what gives the aesthetic its name.
