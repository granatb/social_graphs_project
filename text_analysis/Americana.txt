Americana is a loosely-defined aesthetic which consists of music, artifacts, scenery, folklore, and material culture which are seen as distinctly or especially "American" (i.e., of or relating to what is now the United States and its inhabitants). There is considerable disagreement over what counts as "American" because vast differences exist between different regions and subcultures within American society. For example, most people would put Jazz or Hip-Hop aesthetics in separate categories from Americana, despite both genres being uniquely American in their origins, promulgation, and current praxis. Similarly, Juggalos and the Amish do not fall under the "Americana" umbrella, though Yeehaw might.Much of the aesthetic is characterized by nostalgia for an idealized or imagined past, often seen as "more wholesome" than modern American tastes and mores. The aesthetic is often commercialized: restaurant chains such as Red Robin and Applebee's decorate their interior walls with a seemingly-random collection of mid-20th century artifacts and signage which is affectionately known as "Americana clutter".
