Y2K (also known as Kaybug) is an aesthetic that was prevalent in popular culture from roughly 1995 to 2004. Named after the Y2K Bug, it is characterized by a distinct aesthetic period, encapsulating fashion, hardware design, music, and furnishings shining with tech optimism — sometimes literally. According to the Y2K Aesthetic Institute, some of its aspects include tight leather pants, silver eyeshadow, shiny clothing, Oakleys, gradients, and Blobitecture. Most Y2K aesthetics rely on the use of technology and slick futuristic looks, signaling the optimism of a new era as the 20th century/2nd millennium progressed into the 21st century/3rd millennium. One of the earliest definers of the Y2K aesthetic is the Designers' Republic, a Sheffield-based graphic design studio best known for their work on the Wipeout video game franchise and various album artwork. The Y2K era ended in late 2004 and was succeeded by the Frutiger Aero and McBling era.Y2K aesthetics could've possibly been inspired by other previous futuristic aesthetics such as Retro-Futurism. Some elements of Y2K (especially from the earlier portion of the era) would also cross over into the Vaporwave aesthetic, since it shares Vaporwave's angst towards late-stage capitalism, and its nostalgic desire to retreat into a retrofuturist world promised before Western society entered its current troubled times. However, the Y2K aesthetic has not yet been explored by the Vaporwave scene as much as earlier, more ubiquitous periods (like the '80s–early '90s Neon/Synthwave aesthetic).
