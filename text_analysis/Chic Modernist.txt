Chic Modernist is a type of chic style that combines both the chic style with modern-day designs and styles. In the design world, chic means elegant, fashionable and trendy. Although the word has French origins, chic can be used to describe practically any style with a casual, understated look that is still hip, fresh, updated and modern. Chic can also be something unique, out of the ordinary or one-of-a-kind, such as a vintage item updated with modern colours and patterns. The style aims to reuse timeless pieces in a modern way.
