The country aesthetic is based on the culture of rural farming populations in the American South and Midwest. Farmers and ranchers within the community value tradition and conservative ideals, community, and hard work in their field. The aesthetic places great emphasis on practicality, with a range of activities and items originating from their work and landscape. The style is popular with many people throughout the United States, even if they are not farmers or ranchers, and has been used as a visual trope for weddings, settings for TV shows, and political propaganda. Visually, the aesthetic shares many traits with Western, but there is no emphasis on the 19th century, adventure or lawlessness, and instead focuses on the idea of home and being settled within the farmer lifestyle. And unlike Cottagecore, which romanticizes the countryside and uses feminine aesthetics, Country is a lived reality, even if some visual tropes are used to the point of excess. The people who participate in this aesthetic are unlikely to be aware of the aesthetic community as a whole. The lifestyle has cemented itself among the American mainstream, with it being a theme of multiple home decorating magazines, clothing brands, and even personality types. It is a point of pride for many people to be a "country girl/boy," as their culture emphasizes patriotism and values that are atypical for many modern cities.
