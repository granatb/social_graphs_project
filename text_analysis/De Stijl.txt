De Stijl (Dutch for "The Style") also known as Neoplasticism, was a Dutch art movement founded in 1917 in Leiden by Piet Mondrian. De Stijl consisted of artists and architects. In a narrower sense, the term De Stijl is used to refer to a body of work from 1917 to 1931 founded in the Netherlands. Proponents of De Stijl advocated pure abstraction and universality by a reduction to the essentials of form and colour; they simplified visual compositions to vertical and horizontal, using only black, white and primary colors.
