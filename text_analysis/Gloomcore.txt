Gloomcore is an aesthetic inspired by the tranquil forests and foggy beaches of the pacific northwest, and obscure hobbies and interests. The aim is to appreciate the quiet through dim surroundings. Those who take a liking to such genre tend to find beauty in cloudy skies, foggy coastlines and tall, endless, green forests. Gloomcore folks love all things odd and otherworldly.
