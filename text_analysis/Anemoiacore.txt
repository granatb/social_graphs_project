Anemoiacore is an aesthetic that revolves around the feeling of anemoia, or an extreme longing for a time/ event that never occurred. These feelings are often radiated or channeled by the visualization of certain images, hearing certain music, or smelling a certain scent. The emotions, however, tend to be very saddening, as the experiencer feels an overwhelming want to experience these childhood events. There can be negative or positive feelings of anemoia. The interesting aspect is that these events never occurred; often the visualizer attributes certain images to their past, as they may be similar in nature.
