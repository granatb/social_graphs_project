Writer Academia is an aesthetic that revolves around the art of writing, be it poetry, novels, or even fanfiction. It is centered around the idea that writing is for everyone, and the quality of work does not matter as long as you are passionate about it and having fun. It is the romanticization of writing and literature, in any and all forms.
