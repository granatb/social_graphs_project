Crowcore is primarily derived from Goblincore and Cottagecore. This aesthetic focuses mainly on nature, environmentalism, crows and collecting (usually shiny) objects from nature and urban environments. Crowcore is generally darker than either of its initial inspirations.  Crowcore is sometimes used as an alternative to Goblincore, which has been criticized as anti-Semitic, but which shares the value of collecting small, lost, broken, thrown away, or conventionally trivial objects, and nature visuals.  There is significant Tumblr cross-tagging between Crowcore, Gremlincore, Cottagecore, and various other related aesthetics.
