Studyblr is a subculture on Tumblr that is devoted to studying and taking notes in an organized and aesthetically pleasing manner. It has influenced the creation of other combinations of social media and studying, including Studygram (studying + Instagram), Studytube (studying + YouTube) and Studytok (studying + TikTok).While being a major source of motivation for high school or college students, this study aesthetic offers a wide range of blogs, printables, music playlists and many other types of digital contents in order to romanticize studying.
