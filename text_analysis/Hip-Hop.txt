Hip-hop, also called rap music, is a genre of popular music developed in the United States by inner-city African Americans and Latino Americans in the Bronx borough of New York City in the 1970s. It has four key stylistic elements: MCing/rapping, DJing/scratching with turntables, break dancing (something that came about thanks to Brazilian immigrants of the time practicing their native martial art, Capoeira, out in the streets), and graffiti/graff/writing, other elements include sampling beats or bass lines from records (or synthesized beats and sounds), and rhythmic beatboxing.While hip-hop has evolved considerably away from the streets of the Bronx, it has become perhaps the biggest genre of music in the world, welcoming any and all into its fold if they have the skills to stand out, even with the much-maligned "Mumble Rap" and "Trap" that is currently popular right now, the spirit of DIY that permeates Hip-Hop is alive and well in the new generation.
