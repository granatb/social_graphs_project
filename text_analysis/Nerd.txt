Nerd is a subculture that is associated with students who are very devoted to academics. The term "nerd" originated in the 1950s from a Dr. Seuss book, and has been used for anxious, book-smart culture and people ever since. Nerds will often be seen as lacking social skills, and have many stereotypes surrounding how they dress (e.g. wearing glasses, a bowtie, overalls, high socks, slacks, and/or braces). Nerdy hobbies or interests are a big part of this aesthetic, and include sci-fi and fantasy, board games and video games, STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) subjects and other similar topics.It is one of the four high school stereotypes used in a popular alignment chart, along with Prep, Jock, and Goth.
