Fauvism was an art movement that existed in the early 1900s. The movement clearly broke from Impressionism, as well as other traditional techniques, with its use of bold brushstrokes and vibrant colors. Fauvism was heavily inspired by van Gogh, Paul Gauguin, Georges Seurat, and Paul Cézanne; it was led by Henri Matisse and André Derain.
