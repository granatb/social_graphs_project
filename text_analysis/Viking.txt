Vikings were 8-11th century Norse seafarers from Southern Scandinavia. They hold a prominant part of pop culture with common (yet innacurate) caricatures, one example of which being the horned helmet. The aesthetic is also misappropriated by white supremacists and warped to fit their values. Vikings, unlike the imagined version, were a multicultural and multiethnic collection of societies. As well as this, viking women at that time had a considerable amount of freedom. Contrasting historical accounts describe vikings both as 'Filthiest of all Allah's creatures' (Ibn Fadlan) or "in the habit of combing their hair every day, to bathe every Saturday, to change clothes frequently" (John of Wallingford). The latter is supported by their combs, often with intricate carvings and placed in their burial sites, and that they had bathhouses and saunas. However this may just place them higher on the cleanliness scale than Anglo-saxons, but not as clean as 10th century Muslims.
