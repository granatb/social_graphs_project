Blob Web, or "The Corporate Big Tech Artstyle," is a minimalist visual aesthetic. Taking Minimal and blending it with shades of Corporate, this artstyle aims to create visuals that are easy to mass produce and utilize for commercial purposes. Blob Web dates back to the early 2010s, when gradient-based Frutiger Aero logos began to disappear for cleaner looks. A illustrative style called "Alegria" was developed by media agency Buck for Facebook in 2017. Today, it is seen in various websites, advertisements, logos, and even computer interfaces. As a result, there has been a growing awareness for this minimalist look, with internet users complaining about the monotony and oversaturation of the style.
