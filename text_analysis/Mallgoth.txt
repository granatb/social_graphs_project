Mall goths (also known colloquially as "spooky kids"), originally a term used as an insult, is a term used to describe a subculture (subculture used very debatably here) of "wannabe Goths" in the '90s-early 2000s who would try to imitate the goth style without actually knowing anything about the goth subculture beyond wanting to look the part. Unlike its original subculture which had its origins in Gothic Rock, Mall goths could often be found listening to Nu-Metal, Industrial Metal and Marilyn Manson."Mall goth" is derived from the words "mall" and "goth", referencing how many participants of the subculture would often spend time at shopping malls. In particular, it often references their buying of items from the shop Hot Topic. The term began as pejorative, connoting solely being interested in goth for its fashion, rather than the subculture itself, similar to the use of poseur.
