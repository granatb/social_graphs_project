Tupinipunk(name derived from tupiniquim, a major native-brazilian ethnic group and a slang to refer to anyone or anything that is brazilian) is a term generally used to refer to the sci-fi/Cyberpunk movement in Brazil, predominantly on the literary scene. It was originally coined in the 2000s, to describe a satirical genre that criticized the predominant US-centric and Eurocentric views of the sci-fi genre. It encompasses various different views, criticisms and references, as Brazil is a vast and populated country, and its regions vary greatly from each other in traditions, local cultures, regional lingos and history.  Although the movement has known origins since the 30s, with the novel O Colecionador de MÃ£os (The Hand Collector), by Jeronymo Monteiro, and having multiple representatives through the 20th century, it was mostly considered a cult and underground genre, until its surge in popularity thanks to the widespread reach of information of the internet in the 2000s and 2010s.
