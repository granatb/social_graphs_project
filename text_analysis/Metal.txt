Metal is a term that encompasses a style of heavy, aggressive music. Heavy Metal was the culmination of the Acid rock heard in the late 1960s - a genre that describes the heavier sounding Psychedelic rock first played by various bands of the San Francisco music scene. The genre evolved further throughout the 1970s and into the 1980s, when it first reached mainstream popularity - and simultaneously diversified into myriad sub-genres in the underground scene. Metal music is easy to notice; loud guitars, fast drumming and violent lyrics generally being the main components. Bands credited for the start of metal range from the heavy blues of  Led Zeppelin and Jimi Hendrix, to the occult rock stylings of Coven and Blue Ã–yster Cult, and on to the likes of Alice Cooper, Pentagram and Black Sabbath. Because of the sound, it became cause for panic by Christian parents, who believed the music to be Satanic and a bad influence for children during the 80s. Despite the pushback, metal is still popular in many facets of music, influencing genres such as grunge, nu-metal and rap metal among many, many other subgenres and microgenres. Fans of metal are called headbangers or metalheads.
