Spring is an aesthetic that is focused around the season of the same name, At this time of year, with the melting of the Winter snow, farmers begin to sow seed, while others plant flowers. It alludes to elements such as rebirth, new beginnings, and renewal, and a more hopeful, optimistic vibe, after so many months of cold. The aesthetics that revolve around Spring are centered around motifs such as budding flowers and meadows, baby animals, sunshine, and a "fresh" and "new" feeling.  It can also be a reference to Spring fashion styles.With the more flowery and colorful themes, this season is definetely more feminine-centric in many societies across the world, with all the promotion of "cute" motifs looks for women's wear, but this shouldn't stop men or non-binary folk to express a liking to Spring or join in with the trends.
