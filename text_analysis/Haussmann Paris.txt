Haussmann Paris is the renovation of Paris from 1853-1870, involving new architecture, modernized roads and water structures, creation of parks, etc. However, this page will use the term to describe the lifestyles of the French bourgeoisie in the mid 19th century who enjoyed the new luxuries brought on by Haussmannization. This type of life was mostly depicted through Impressionist painting and the concept of the "fl√¢neur," who is a middle-class intellectual who observed people within the city. There is a strong emphasis on leisure activities that this class of Parisians was able to afford.
