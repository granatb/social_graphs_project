Oshare Kei (お洒落系) is the opposite side of Visual Kei with bright colors and many pop impressions. Thus said, bands under this style live up to the meaning by dressing up in colorful costumes, or in Decora or Pop Kei style. So, many of them are seen sporting massive amounts of jewelry and bags of cartoon characters and animals slung on, tons of hairclips that make you go dizzy because you'd lose count, and lighter make-up. The music is more happy sounding, the lyrics lighter and happier.
