Author's Note: To spare you the confusion, when we're talking about the aesthetic in question, we will be referring to the aesthetic in normal lettering while any references to the show will be italicized for your convenience.The Jersey Shore aesthetic first started rising in prominence around the mid-to-late 2000's and eventually fell out of style in the early 2010's that was centered around the stereotyped perception of Italian-Americans from around the New York/New Jersey area.  Its meteoric rise and nightmarish fall coincide with the smash hit MTV reality TV show Jersey Shore.  If you don't think this qualifies as an entry into the Aesthetics Wiki, I present to you this article: https://www.racked.com/2018/4/4/17189352/jersey-shore-reunion-ed-hardy-fcuk  Fortunately, for the vast majority of people, the Jersey Shore aesthetic has retreated back to the New York/New Jersey area since when Jersey Shore announced it was ending, most people were quite happy with this news, and the Jersey Shore reunion has not inspired any sort of revival.  It was always associated with working-class urban Italian-Americans with a tendency to try and be as macho as possible.  While the term itself dates back to the 1970s to 1980s (where that era Jersey Shore aesthetic may actually play a role in some of the aesthetics involved in Synthwave), the modern Jersey Shore that is often associated with the Jersey Shore tag didn't come into style until the mid-to-late 2000s; starting off as an internet meme before MTV decided to unleash it onto the world with Jersey Shore.
