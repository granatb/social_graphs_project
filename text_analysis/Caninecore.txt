Caninecore is an aesthetic based on canines. This particular aesthetic ranges from human bred dogs to wild wolves, containing lots of sub genres. Caninecore is generally centered around being a dog enthusiast, and doesn't have much of a history.    Caninecore often takes other aesthetics and blends them with canines. For instance, cottagecore mixed with  caninecore would look very different to cryptidcore mixed with caninecore. Caninecore by itself is a very flexible aesthetic, the only requirement for caninecore is canines. Caninecore is often influenced by therianthropy, animal-hearted people, pet regressors, and furries. Caninecore is especially popular on Tumblr and Pinterest and within the general art community.
