Art Deco is a twentieth century aesthetic that emerged after World War 1. It flourished in the 1920s, 1930s, and 1940s, before becoming less popular after World War Two ended. There have been multiple revivals, such as in the 1980s. Art Deco's influence permeated everything from architecture to jewelry. The style uses geometric forms, clean lines, and is often angular or streamlined. Colors are usually bold and chosen for contrast. Patterns are bold, symmetrical, and geometric. Popular materials were Bakelite, plastics, chrome, steel, aluminum, as well as stained glass, lacquer, and inlays.  The Art Deco aesthetic is also very important to Dieselpunk and Decopunk, as without Art Deco, neither would really exist.
