Modernism was a movement that encompassed philosophy, art, architecture, literature, and music. It lasted from 1910 to 1939, though it appeared to begin in the 1870s and more accurately ended in 1945, after the atomic bomb was dropped. This led to Postmodernism.Modernism was a rejection of tradition and the Enlightenment values that had once consumed Europe. People started to feel like ideologies (religious and moral) and culture were falling apart, which went against Enlightenment ideals; Modernism embraced this fragmentation of culture. This means that Modernism can also be seen as a state of mind that continues to this day.
