Yume Kawaii (ゆめかわいい) is a Japanese aesthetic that refers to pastel, fairytale, fantasy-like things. It appears like the embodiment of a “girls dream” and you can find many illustrations, clothing, and goods, which incorporate this. Due to the nature of dreams, it can also feature nightmarish elements.
