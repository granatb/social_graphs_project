Crackhead (not to be confused with Drugcore enthusiasts who are literal crackheads) is an aesthetic centered around being chaotic, unpredictable, stupid, clumsy, lazy, and inconvenient dumbasses. The term is very popular on Tumblr and among school kids. The aesthetic has no relations with actual drugs.Chaos and signs of dumbassery can be found everywhere, and so can spilled foods, chipped fingernails, wet socks, lost wallets, unbrushed hair, disorganized workspaces, etc, which are all examples of the eternal presence of a Crackhead.
