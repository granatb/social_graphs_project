Due to the controversial actions of many capitalist regimes throughout the world and in history, the Aesthetics Wiki does not support the human rights violations and war crimes committed by these movements, but it is important to acknowledge the importance that capitalism has had on world history and its impact on modern culture. Viewer discretion is advised.“I believe in total immersion, if you want to be rich, you have to program your mind to be rich. You have to unlearn all the thoughts that were making you poor and replace them with new thoughts – rich thoughts.” - Jordan Belfort         Hustlewave is an aesthetic that is rooted in capitalist and opportunist thought. It's an amalgamation of Futurism and right wing economic schools of thought (like Objectivism). Think of the classic rags to riches success story, kid makes cool tech in his garage, fast forward 15 years and he's a techbro blamed for the increase of housing prices in the San Francisco/Bay Area. Hustlewave in its purest form is gaining power and succeeding in life through money rather than politics. Though Hustlewave is also about managing to bring the future to today, and making a profit off of it.  In many ways, Hustlewave is the polar opposite of the anti-capitalist/anti-consumerist notes often found in a genre like Vaporwave and is the polar opposite; the Laborwave aesthetic, with it's goal being to become the Techbro/Cyberprep equivalent to Vaporwave's Cyberpunk.
