Not to be confused with the medium.Mangas is a term used to described working-class boys in Greece during the Belle Ã‰poque era of French/Western history (roughly from 1871 up until the beginning of World War 1 in 1914) who behave in an incredibly arrogant manner.  Despite the subculture dating back over 100 years, the term is still used in Greece today the way English-speakers may use the term "dude".  This is not to be confused with "Manga", the Japanese equivalent of an American comic book.  If you're looking for that aesthetic, please swing over to the Animecore page.
