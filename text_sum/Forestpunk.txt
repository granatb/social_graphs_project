While the examples mentioned earlier are good guides, take a look at the image on the right for more modern inspiration.For example, a cabin in the middle of the woods, surrounded by vines & trees, living off rainwater & produce, feeding toads & deer while collecting their bones for decoration. Or, an apartment with solar panels with plants dotting the walls, rocks & buttermoths moving around, buying locally & dressed in greens & light browns
