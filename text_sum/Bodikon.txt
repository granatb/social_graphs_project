The style was most popular in the mid-to-late 1980s and early 1990s (usually around the period late 1985 to 1991 at the peak of its popularity). Bodikon (ボディコン), or often referred to as “Bubble Queen” style post-Bubble, is a style and increasingly a general aesthetic, that was centered around the distinctive style of dress by the same name, the bodycon, (of which its name is a shortening of the pronunciation of the English words "body conscious"), but was not entirely based around the dress, and would come to include the general female fashion of the Bubble Economy period
