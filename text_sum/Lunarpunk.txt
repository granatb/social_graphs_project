"Punk" intends to reference both the futuristic setting of a Lunarpunk society as well as the struggle against a more suspicious, mysterious government/overruling power. Visuals of the aesthetic are borrowed from pagan, satanic, Wiccan, or anarchist references, and the architecture is a mixture of futuristic shapes as well as mushroom-inspired, luminescent, nature-based designs
