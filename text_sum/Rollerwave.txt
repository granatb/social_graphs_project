The name is a reference to the 1975 James Caan film Rollerball, and like the film, the aesthetic often delves into 1970s retrofuturism, however, unlike standard Retro-Futurism or Atompunk, Rollerwave deals only with the 70s, and has a far less Jetson-y feel. Rollerwave is an aesthetic which does for the 70s what Outrun does for the 80s and Vaporwave does for the 90s
