Gothic originally started as a type of architecture starting in the 12th century Europe, with significant characteristics being pointy arches and usually applied on flying buttresses. Gothic art would eventually evolve into more than a type of outer design, with the label being applied to artwork, poems, books, fashion and eventually shows and video games
