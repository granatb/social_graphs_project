Cottagegore (also known as Goth Cottagecore or Dark Cottagecore) is similar to Cottagecore, in the sense it has a strong focus on country life, baking, and vintage items, but contrary to its name, it instead includes darker aspects of nature (including rotten mushroom or plant aesthetics, forest cryptids, spirits or ghosts, and bones found in nature) as opposed to just taking the Cottagecore aesthetic and throwing a bunch of blood and gore on it
