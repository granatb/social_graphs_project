Tweencore is an aesthetic that shares some similarities with Kidcore, maintaining the nostalgic and "childish" themes, but also embodying teen spirit often associated with the High School Dream aesthetic. It tends to borrow heavily from Animecore (especially more feminine animes like Sailor Moon and Fruits Basket), Scene, and Old Web (while also taking some fashion cues from the McBling aesthetic that this was inspired by)
