Aesthetics Wiki does not endorse Nazi ideology - but it is important to acknowledge its impact on modern culture.Fashwave (a portmanteau of the terms "fascism" and "wave") is a derivative aesthetic of Synthwave or Vaporwave that is associated with alt-right/far-right/dissident right beliefs like upholding tradition, maintaining racial purity, Anti-Semitism, ultranationalism, and a rejection of post-modernist thought (which a lot of the modern aesthetics on this Wiki are actually examples of). It's not unusual for people from the Fashwave scene to try and assimilate into the more "mainstream" Synthwave or Vaporwave scenes, but they are often sniffed out pretty quickly and given the boot because nobody wants to associate with actual Neo-Nazis.Fashwave is just an extension of the alt-right, an amalgamation of various far-right groups such as Neo-Nazis, Neo-Confederates, skinheads (nothing to do with the Skinheads aesthetic), white nationalists, white supremacists, and other like-minded individuals in an attempt to establish a wholly white ethnostate by any means necessary (though they'll never actually admit it because they know their actual worldview is highly unpopular these days)
