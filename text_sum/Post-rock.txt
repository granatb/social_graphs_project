Post-Rock is a genre of music which, unlike regular rock music, does not focus on riffs, lyrics and melody, as but much more on drones, harmonies, sound texture and evocating the feeling that it's the end of the world but it's also okay because Some Mysterious Grand Light is coming to save us all from ourselves. This genre of music usually has no lyrics, but lyrics can be used to evoke a symbolic and darker meaning when further investigated.Important bands in the genre include:Godspeed You!
