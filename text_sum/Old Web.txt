Essentially consisting of screencaps and gifs, Old Web is an aesthetic utilizing traditional web design elements combined with aspects of poetry and self-expression. This aesthetic expresses nostalgia for Internet culture of the mid-1990s to late 2000s (spanning roughly Windows 95 to the glory days of YouTube).Old Web's philosophical heart yearns for the days of uninhibited individualism of the old web, before the internet became streamlined and social media monopolized how people communicated, and web graphic design developed a stricter set of rules for the "dos" and "don'ts" for the sake of accessibility and marketing.Many Old Web screencaps and gifs come from archived Geocities websites made by amateur coders and animators
