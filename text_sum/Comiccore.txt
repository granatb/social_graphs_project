Comiccore does not concern superheroes, which dominate the industry to the extent they constitute an entirely separate aesthetic, or Manga, which is thematically and visually as far removed from Western comics as Anime is from Western cartoons. Unlike Pop Art, which can sometimes include comic elements (as in the case of Roy Lichtenstein's famous piece Whaam) comiccore is less self-referential and deconstructive, instead referring to the inherent and unique properties of comics themselves
