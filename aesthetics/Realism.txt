Realists rejected Romanticism, which had dominated French literature and art since the early 19th century. \n\nRealists used unprettified detail depicting the existence of ordinary contemporary life, coinciding in the contemporaneous naturalist literature of\u00a0\u00c9mile Zola,\u00a0Honor\u00e9 de Balzac, and\u00a0Gustave Flaubert.\n\nRealism is the precise, detailed and accurate representation in art of the visual appearance of scenes and objects. Realism in this sense is also called naturalism, mimesis or illusionism.\n\nRealistic art was created in many periods, and it is in large part a matter of technique and training, and the avoidance of stylization.\n\n== Artists ==\nMany artists have made realist works of art.
