There are notably some sub-communities, including but not limited to '''therianthropy''', '''fictionkin''', and '''factkin'''. These groups, as well as other terms, are included in the glossary at the bottom.\n\nThe otherkin community has notably contributed to aesthetic communities, especially on sites like Tumblr and Pinterest (though they can be found nearly anywhere). These contributions often include moodboards based on '''kintypes'''. Not all 'kin engage with aesthetic communities and their own identities in this way, but some do.\n\nOtherkin has been taken out of context by some, using it to describe things they simply relate to, or for roleplay purposes. While neither of these things are bad on their own, the misuse of otherkin terms has harmed the community through misunderstandings, and the devaluing of '''spiritual'''/'''psychological 'kin'''<nowiki/>'s experiences.\n\n* <font size=\"2\">There is an <u>important distinction</u> to be made between '''spiritual/psych.''' '''<nowiki/>'kin''' and \"'''kin for fun'''\"/[https://therian.fandom.com/wiki/Otherlink otherlinkers]. The primary difference is:</font>\n** <font size=\"2\"><u>Spiritual/psychological</u> kin is ''involuntary'', and often involves more than just acting like a kintype.</font>\n** <font size=\"2\"><u>Otherlinking</u> is ''voluntary'', and usually doesn't involve more than purposefully taking on an identity for recreation.</font>\n\n* <font size=\"2\">This means kins-for-fun are <u>unable to understand</u> important aspects of spiritual/psych. 'kin's identities and experiences.</font>\n* <font size=\"2\">This is <u>not to say</u> that spiritual/psych. 'kin ''can't'' <u>have fun with their identities</u>, nor that people shouldn't <u>voluntarily take on an identity</u> for any reason, though it's good to be aware of this distinction and the possible spread of misinformation.</font>\n\nThere are a few different ways in which 'kin/related identities can develop. This can be through imprinting, a result of neurodivergence, as a method of coping, or in relation to spiritual beliefs. Many people recall experiences relating to their 'kin identity from childhood that were unrealized until later. Others may develop it over time without notice. \n\nOtherkin is a phenomenon that can deeply affect people's daily lives: through '''kinshifts''', '''memories''', and even possibly <u>trauma,</u> which is believed to be carried over from past lives. It is important to remember the impact it has on people, regardless of what you believe.\n\n<br />\n\n== Factkin ==\nIt is also important to recognize the fact that trolls were how the term \u2018factkin\u2019 (identifying as a different real person) was originated, and the majority of otherkin individuals do not wish to be associated with them\n\n== Glossary ==\n<div class=\"mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\">\n<b><u>Classification</u></b>\n<div class=\"mw-collapsible-content\">\n* '''Otherkin'''\n** The <u>name/umbrella term</u> for the community.\n** Also refers to <u>being kin with</u> things such as elves, dragons, angels/demons, and similar groups.\n*** <font size=\"2\">Otherkin was originally an offshoot of elvenkind, the first popular kin group that existed on the internet. The term was created (originally as \"otherkind\") to differentiate between elves, and non-elves who were a part of the community.<ref>https://frameacloud.com/nonfiction/otherkin-timeline-abridged/</ref></font>\n* '''Therianthropy'''\n** Therianthropes (or therians) are those who are <u>kin with real-world species</u>. The most well-known theriantype by far are those who are kin with wolves.\n** <font size=\"2\">Not all therians necessarily consider themselves to be \"otherkin\"; the community can be seen as another subculture which has notable overlap.</font>\n* '''Fictionkin'''\n** Those who are <u>kin with things found in fiction</u>, like characters or species.\n* '''Factkin'''\n** Those who are kin with real people (whether they are currently alive or not).\n** <font size=\"2\">This group is often a center of debate in the community. Many claim it is inherently harmful, or identity theft, but others claim this is hypocritical; due to spiritual/psych. 'kin's identities being involuntary, and how many serious 'kin believe in reincarnation and/or the multiverse theory. All this being said, it <u>should not</u> be treated as a means to unfairly judge an individual.</font>\n* There are also other, smaller classifications of otherkin, such as '''conceptkin''', '''objectkin''', '''songkin''', and others. Their names should be self-explanatory.\n</div></div>\n\n<div class=\"mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\">\n<b><u>Other Terms</u></b>\n<div class=\"mw-collapsible-content\">\n* '''Spiritual kin'''\n** Those who <u>incorporate spiritual beliefs</u> into their otherkin identity, whether through belief in reincarnation, multiverse, or something else.\n*** <font size=\"2\">There is also a distinction between spiritual kintypes and past lives. Kintypes <u>do not</u> have to be past lives, and vice versa - one important facet of otherkin is that identities are relevant and important to the individual in the current moment.</font>\n* '''Psychological kin'''\n** Those whose minds <u>latch or imprint</u> onto something to the point where it becomes a 'kin identity.\n*** <font size=\"2\">Most often, those who have psychological kintypes are <u>neurodivergent</u>. (ADHD, ASD, BPD, OCD, DID/OSDD, etc.)</font>\n* '''Hearted''' (usually a suffix, like <u>otherhearted</u> or <u>fictionhearted</u>) or '''kith''' (like <u>kithtype)</u>\n** When someone identifies <u>with</u>, not <u>as</u> something. Commonly described as a feeling of familial connection, or something one feels they \"should\" have been. Not equivalent to simply relating to something.\n** <font size=\"2\">A similar, broader term also exists for a closely related concept; being the term [https://otherkin.fandom.com/wiki/Synpaths synpath]. The term was made for anyone- 'kin or not -to use.</font>\n* '''Copinglink''' / '''c-link'''\n** <u>Taking on an identity (most commonly) voluntarily</u>, usually to help cope with trauma and/or everyday life, or to help relax.\n*** <font size=\"2\">Copinglink's purpose serves to help the c-linker emotionally. It is similar to otherlink in that it is voluntary, and while c-link shifting is a thing, people tend not to have other kin-related experiences with c-links. Unlike kins-for-fun, c-linking is widely accepted, as it makes a clear distinction between voluntary and involuntary identities. </font>\n* \"'''Kin for fun'''\" / '''kin(s)-for-fun''' / [https://therian.fandom.com/wiki/Otherlink otherlinkers]  \n** <u>Taking on an identity voluntarily</u> usually just for <u>recreation</u>; closer in proximity to <u>roleplaying</u> and pretend.\n*** <font size=\"2\">Serious 'kin may dislike for kins-for-fun, since its prevalence has warped the way many view otherkin due to the shared usage of the term \"kin\", and the way a notable amount of kins-for-fun tend to act and treat serious otherkin experiences.</font>\n*** <font size=\"2\">A small amount of people are fine with kins-for-fun as they are, while others may accept only if they specifically use \"otherlink\" or similar terms to differentiate between voluntary and involuntary identities. The vast majority of serious 'kin, however, are opposed to kins-for-fun due to their behaviour.</font>\n* '''-type''' (like <u>kintype</u>, <u>theriantype</u>, or <u>fictotype</u>)\n** A kintype is <u>something that someone is kin with</u>. Kintypes can be entire species, a fictional character, etc.\n*** <font size=\"2\">Someone can have <u>just one</u> kintype (called <u>monokin</u>), OR <u>two or more</u> kintypes (called <u>polykin</u>). There is no maximum amount of kintypes.</font>\n* '''Shift / Kinshift'''\n** A shift is when an individual <u>feels more close to an otherkin identity</u>. This can be emotionally, mentally, or even through experiencing <u>phantom body parts</u>, as well as a few rarer ways. Shifts can be triggered unexpectedly, or by interacting with media, listening to specific music, or having certain real-life experiences.\n* '''Memories''' / '''mems'''\n** Kin memories are <u>memories that one has as their kintype(s)</u>. They can either come unexpectedly or be triggered by interacting with media, or having real-life experiences, much like shifts can be triggered. Memories may also bring trauma related to a kintype, but this is not true for everyone.\n</div></div>\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery widths=\"130\">\nAngelkin.jpg|an example of an Angelkin moodboard\n</gallery>\n<references />https://seriousotherkin.tumblr.com/post/145201890476/whats-factkin-i-saw-a-blog-saying-theyre\n\nhttps://otherkin.fandom.com/wiki/Factkin\n[[Category:Visual]]\n[[Category:Needs work]]\n[[Category:Recognized Community]]"}}}]}}}}
