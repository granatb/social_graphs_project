Feel the cosmos whirling around\"}}\n[[File:Black-cyber-punk-outfit.jpg|alt=|thumb]]\n'''Cyberpunk''', as a genre, includes a wide variety of visual aesthetics but is recognised by its encompassing theme of \"high tech, low life.\" This became prominent in the 1980s. thanks to the works of authors like Philip K. Dick, Roger Zelazny, J. G. Ballard, Philip Jose Farmer, and Harlan Ellison as they examined the impact of drug culture, technology, and the sexual revolution while avoiding the utopian tendencies of earlier science fiction.\n\nSettings in the cyberpunk genre range from the richly colored, rough-around-the-edges urban jungles of Akira (1988), to the hyper-futuristic, neon cityscapes and bleak wastelands of Blade Runner 2049 (2017), with the first work in cyberpunk fiction being William Gibson's ''Neuromancer ''novel.\n\nThemes used in cyberpunk media involve artificial intelligence, class uprising, governmental and corporate corruption, anarchy, gang warfare, and transhumanism. The range is broad but the cyberpunk aesthetic is often used to convey deeper meanings and commentate on modern society and sometimes predictions of our future society.\n\nCyberpunk was likely the partial inspiration (or anti-inspiration) for [[Solarpunk]] - an aesthetic that also aspires to cast a glance into the future, but does so with a much less nihilistic perspective and played a role in inspiring [[Vaporwave]] since both seem to share a seeming disdain for mainstream capitalism, but Vaporwave is more sarcastic and mocking compared to Cyberpunk, which is more open with its disdain for the corporate dystopia. In truth, most online aesthetics almost completely owe their entire existence to Cyberpunk and its rebelliousness to the status quo of the 1980s; everything from the [[Steampunk]] and [[Dieselpunk]] of yesteryear to any sort of micro-genres that will pop up in the future.\n==Fashion==\nCyberpunk fashion, also known as ''tech wear'', is heavily influenced by films like Johnny Mnemonic, Blade Runner, and The Matrix and could be interpreted as being \"futuristic gothic fashion\" and involves trench coats, boots, shiny black clothing, colored \"dreads\" that women might wear, etc.\n===Cyberpunk Vendors===\n\n*[https://www.crisiswear.com/ CRISISWEAR]\n*[https://cryoflesh.com/ Cryoflesh]\n*[https://www.cyberdog.net/ Cyberdog]\n*[https://dustrial.net/ DUSTRIAL]\n*[https://www.futurstate.com/ Futurestate]\n*[https://high-cybergypsy.com/ High-Cyber Gypsy]\n*[https://memetictees.com/ Memetic Tees]\n*[https://neo4ic.com/ Neo4ic]\n*[http://www.plastikwrap.com/ Plastik Wrap]\n*[https://ragenationapparel.com/ R.A.G.E.

There just seems to be something encoded into the DNA of cyberpunk that makes it incredibly compatible with a lot of future-themed speculative media, even that aimed for children (an argument could even be made that the Sonic SatAM series from the '90s is something of an example of cyberpunk since it involves a group of freedom fighters fighting back an oppressive technologically-based regime run by Dr. Robotnik).\n\n===Movies===\n\n*Blade Runner\n*Idiocracy\n*Johnny Mnemonic\n*Snowpiercer\n*The Matrix\n*Babylon A.D.[[File:Running In The Night The Superb '80s Cyberpunk Artworks By Daniele Gasparini.jpg|alt=|thumb|Aesthetic]]\n\n===TV Shows===\n\n*Altered Carbon\n*Black Mirror\n*Infinity Train\n*Reboot\n*Almost Human (2013-2014)\n\n===Anime===\n\n*Akira\n*Ghost in the Shell\n*Exaella\n*Armitage III\n*Cyber City Oedo 808\n*Cowboy Bebop\n*Serial Experiments Lain\n*Ergo Proxy\n*Mardock Scramble: The First Compression\n*Texhnolyze\n*Neon Genesis Evangelion\n*Battle Angel Alita\n*\u00c6on Flux\n*Appleseed\n*Bubblegum Crisis\n*Parasite Dolls\n*Aeon Flux\n*Sky Blue\n*Blame!\n*Heat Guy J\n*Vexille\n*Eve no Jikan\n*Pale Cocoon\n*Baldr Force EXE Resolution\n*Paranoia Agent\n*Paprika(Anime film)\n*Summer Wars\n*.hack //SIGN\n*.hack //Roots\n\n==Video Games==\n\nThe cyberpunk genre has spurred the creation of various cyberpunk-themed video games such as ''Cloudpunk'', ''Va-11 Hall-A'', and most notably ''Cyberpunk 2077.''\n\n* 2064: Read Only Memories\n* \u00c6on Flux\n* Akira\n* Anachronox\n* Angel Devoid: Face of the Enemy\n* Blade Runner\n* Cloudpunk\n* Cyberpunk 2077\n* Deus Ex\n* Gemini Rue\n* Ghost in the Shell\n*G-String\n* Hard Reset\n*.hack//G.U.\n* Hover\n*Hypnospace Outlaw\n*I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream\n*Ingress: The Animation\n*Kane & Lynch 2: Dog Days\n* Mirror's Edge\n* Neocron\n* Neuromancer\n* Observer\n* Paradise Cracked\n* Primordia\n* Raid 2020\n* Remember Me\n* Rez Infinite\n* Rise of the Dragon\n* Ruiner\n* Shadowrun\n* Snatcher\n* State of Mind\n*Stray\n* Syndicate\n* System Shock\n* Technobabylon\n* The Ascent\n* The Red Strings Club\n*The Last Station\n* The Solitaire Conspiracy\n*The Spectrum Retreat\n* Transistor\n* Uplink\n* Va-11 Hall-A\n* VirtuaVerse\n\n==Music==\nWhile Cyberpunk itself is not a genre of music (nor does it have one genre associated with it), there are some characteristics of music that tend to make it sound Cyberpunk. These characteristics include the use of synthesizers, Cyberpunk themes, and sounding dark. Music is typically lacks vocals.

This very philosophy has very close ties to the Cyberpunk aesthetic in that, what's more Cyberpunk than becoming part human/part machine?  There have also been numerous examples of protagonists in Cyberpunk fiction that are transhuman in their own right (most famously, Motoko Kusanagi from Ghost in the Shell is an example of Transhumanism in Cyberpunk).\n\n===Cybersecurity and Hacker Culture===\nCybersecurity (also known as information security or infosec), is the practice of protecting computer systems and data from security hackers, cybercriminals, spies, or other bad actors.<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_security</ref> \"Hackers\" are now generally understood to be bad actors, but hacker culture reclaims the label for people who see programming and computer systems as a medium of freedom and creativity.<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_culture</ref>\n\nThe \"high tech, low life\" nature of cybersecurity is often reflected in the offensive and defensive security operatives of cyberpunk fiction and media. In Neuromancer, the protagonist Henry Case is a security hacker working to penetrate corporate computer networks. In Ghost in the Shell, Motoko Kusanagi is referred to as a hacker as short hand for her programming ability which she uses to investigate and prevent cybercrime.\n\nMany characters in cyberpunk fiction and media embody hacker culture and the hacker ethic, which asserts that all information should be free.<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_ethic</ref> The protagonists of The Matrix embody the late 1990s self-image of hackers attempting to free humanity from corporate dominiation of technology.<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cathedral_and_the_Bazaar</ref> Today, many advocates and users of free and open source software adopt a cyberpunk aesthetic, as demonstrated by the [https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/iu9354/i3_cyberpunk_in_progress_d/ r/unixporn subreddit].\n\nThe Cyberpunk community has a strong interest in privacy and cybersecurity.<ref>https://cyberpunkforums.com/viewtopic.php?id=3160</ref> Members of the community advocate improving personal privacy and security by using linux and tools like DuckDuckGo, Firefox, and VPNs.<ref>https://cyberpunked.org</ref> Other resources for personal privacy and security are [https://www.privacytools.io/ privacytools.io] and the Electronic Frontier Foundation's [https://ssd.eff.org/en Surveillance Self-Defense].\n\n== Online Communities ==\n* [https://cyberpunkforums.com Collective Cyberpunk Community Forums]\n* [https://www.reddit.com/r/Cyberpunk/ r/Cyberpunk]\n\n==Subgenres and Derivatives==\n\n=== Biopunk ===\nBiopunk is a subgenre of Cyberpunk that focuses on biotechnology.\n\n''For more information, see [[Biopunk]].''\n\n===Bronzepunk===\nBronzepunk takes Greco-Roman aesthetics and puts them into a pseudo-modern world. The name comes from the use of bronze-age technology, albiet with modern twists.\n\n''For more information, see [[Bronzepunk]].''\n\n===Clockpunk===\nClockpunk takes elements of Cyberpunk and puts them into a Renaissance setting. Some call it steampunk without the steam.<ref>http://ingmaralbizu.com/clockpunk-and-the-perils-of-reimagining-the-past/</ref>\n\n''For more information, see [[Clockpunk]].''\n\n===Ironpunk===\nIronpunk adds traits of Cyberpunk to an Iron Age setting.\n\n===Nowpunk===\nNowpunk essentially says that Cyberpunk is now. Bruce Sterling used it to describe his 2005 novel, titled ''The Zenith Angle''.\n\n''For more information, see [[Nowpunk]].''\n\n===Solarpunk===\nSolarpunk is the opposite of cyberpunk. It features an optimistic view of the future, emphasizing renewable energy, handcrafted wares, and anti-capitalism.\n\n''For more information, see [[Solarpunk]].''\n\n===Lunarpunk===\nLunarpunk is closely related to Solarpunk with its emphasis on nature and renewable energy, with an addition of witchcraft.\n\n''For more information, see [[Lunarpunk]].''\n\n===Tupinipunk===\nTupinipunk refers to the Brazilian sci-fi/cyberpunk movement. This is a criticism of the Euro-centric and US-centric views that tend to dominate Cyperpunk.\n\n''For more information, see [[Tupinipunk]].''\n\n==Images==\n<gallery widths=\"130\" spacing=\"medium\" orientation=\"landscape\">\nLain.jpg|Serial Experiments Lain\nTumblr nau2xj5mCH1r3rdh2o1 500.png|Ghost in the Shell (1995)\nSAMURAI-GIRL\u8868\u7d19.jpg|From Julie Watai's SAMURAI-GIRLS photography set with cyberpunk elements\nDqv2TuG.jpg\nAkira-post.jpg|Akira (1988)\nCpwiki.jpg\nCpwiki666.jpg|Things are going to get chilly when the capitalists upload their consciousnesses into giant servers which will be kept cool by blocking out the sun\nCpwiki1.jpg|de/human(eyes) your 'self'\nCpwiki2.jpg|Kiss the cybernetwork with your mouth open wide.\nCpwiki4.png|Blade Runner could be seen as the epitome of cyberpunk\nCpwikiakira.jpg\nCpwikirucp.jpg\nTumblr pgx24vFnMa1qz71z8o6 r1 500.jpg|We're in the Cyberpunk era now, fam!\n9078911587 9256cea6f2.jpg\nEuropolis street.jpg\n15339563.jpg\n35510.gif\nGiphy60.gif\nGiphy5.gif\nDddd220b1458dc3124516aa02528eecb.gif\nDdboxib-4b360266-bd90-42d5-a2ec-64262c114c3a.gif\nPicgifs-mirrors-edge-5141411.gif\nR0stFAv.gif\n15304.gif\nCyber-punk-neon-sunglasses.jpg\nCyber-punk-black-outfit-woman.jpg\nBlack-cyber-punk-outfit.jpg\nBlack-combat-outfit-fem.jpg\n8FE43D2A-9CF1-40F3-B889-57233871DB3C.png|Johnny Silverhand, a character in the video game ''Cyberpunk 2077''.\nCp veiw.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==Sources==\n[[Category:Punk Suffix]]\n[[Category:Visual]]\n[[Category:Fashion]]\n[[Category:Written]]\n[[Category:Music]]\n[[Category:Fiction-based aesthetics]]\n[[Category:Electronic]]"}}}]}}}}
