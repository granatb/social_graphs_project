It revolves around the concept of otherworldly magic and is heavily inspired by fantasy media created for young girls. This genre focuses on the concept of magic being tied to the soul and the artistic interpretation of that feeling. It is dream-like, surreal, magical, otherworldly, and pure. It is the brightest, most colorful light that luminates hope in a dark world.    \n\n== Visual ==\nOne of the key elements of this aesthetic is the unnatural emphasis or exaggeration of fantasy elements for the sole purpose of conveying the aesthetic. This aesthetic uses both color theory and artistic interpretation to convey the concept of magic being tied to one's soul or identity. It also has much to do with the restoration of things, people, or places covered in darkness and the expulsion of badness. \n\n== Fashion ==\n<br />\n== Media ==\nOne of the concepts that this aesthetic revolves around is the concept of an \"ethereal form.\" These \"forms\" are brought to life when one discovers the power of an element about themselves that is a part of their soul identity. Examples of the demonstration of this aesthetic in media include:\n\n* Starlight Brigade\n*The scene paired with the bridge of Into the Unknown in Frozen II\n* The scene paired with Show Yourself in Frozen II\n* The Crystal Kingdom in My Little Pony: Friendship Games\n* Twilight Sparkle's Midnight Sparkle form in Equestria Girls: Friendship Games\n* Many of the scenes in Genshin Impact\n* Much of the scenery of Steven Universe\n\nRelated characters include:\n\n* Glimmer from She-Ra and the Princesses of Power\n* Princess Celestia from My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic\n*Princess Cadence from My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic\n* Princess Flurry Heart from My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic\n* Silverstream from My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic\n* Sangonomia Kokomi from Genshin Impact\n* Light Fury from How to Train Your Dragon\n* Suicune from Pokemon\n* Primarina from Pokemon\n* Nevy Nervine from Ava's Demon\n* Winter Wonder Neeko from League of Legends\n* Elsa from Frozen\n* Pearl from Steven Universe\n* Sisudatu from Raya and the Last Dragon\n* Farrah Goodfairy from Ever After High\n* Glimmerwing Dragon from DragonVale\n* Iden Dragon from DragonVale\n* Swiftgrace Dragon from DragonVale\n* Reminiscence Dragon from DragonVale\n* Strive from Starlight Brigade\n\n== Music ==\n\nSongs associated with Auroracore include:\n\n* Into the Unknown by Idina Menzel\n*Forbidden Friendship by John Powell\n* Pisces by Xan Griffin\n* Strange Clouds by ufo ufo\n* Elements by Lindsey Stirling\n* Let Love Win by TheFatRat\n* Third Date by John Powell\n*Show Yourself by Idina Menzel\n* Nova by Ahrix\n* Libra by Xan Griffin\n* Threnody by TheFatRat\n* Mirror Haus by Lindsey Stirling\n* Dark Sea by Christophe Beck\n* Monody (A TheFatRat Orchestration) by Rush Garcia\n* The Hidden World by John Powell<br />\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nFile:ADF08DF2-D6D8-4234-8EB5-CB2BB26584E4.jpeg\nFile:Pastel Celestial Fantasy Butterfly Necklace.jpg\nFile:397CF8E1-025A-4733-BFC6-FBBFBF532823.jpeg\nFile:5B29A9D2-4C7E-488E-83C7-818BBAFFBE83.jpeg\nFile:Pastel Celestial Fantasy Gemstones Crowns.jpg\nFile:Pastel Celestial Fantasy Dress.jpg\nFile:CBA4016C-FDF8-41DB-8E75-1018F82CD2D2.jpeg\nFile:444C0A00-9881-46BA-95E5-5F6237831E46.jpeg\nFile:2DDE9856-0148-4F4E-8E85-FC647DD3E46C.jpeg\nFile:A4D7929F-79DB-420E-8040-4E256154A933 4 5005 c.jpeg\nFile:BB93E19B-9E86-43E2-9022-459A5628A48A 4 5005 c.jpeg\nFile:555F5139-B8C6-4B69-96AF-210168F5E705.jpeg\nFile:81A0B454-F1F3-44F4-9C08-030B3F049557.jpeg\nFile:2C7759BC-DC26-440A-94F2-3D4FDFFBD1CC.jpeg\nFile:31A46EF8-CBC4-4CC8-9B22-88457AF4EC9C.jpeg\nFile:A591FDB6-A7FC-43E5-9AD1-C77557DCE9D1.png\nFile:43ECB29E-3287-4474-ABF0-E5EA8C7BF8A0.png\nFile:3C175884-E4D4-4150-A1CB-AA620F459ABB 1 105 c.jpeg\nFile:C72CA0AA-8D7B-459F-9937-E452DD690F25.jpeg\nFile:10DA87BE-1A66-496F-AFFA-17A0B811721A 1 105 c.jpeg\nFile:706DB8D3-D553-4D8E-A426-BBDF7041FFE9.png\nFile:F8447590-76D5-4FA0-B0CF-77E47F06300B.jpeg\nFile:9166951F-0C83-44AF-8FCF-619C6A5BA85A.jpeg\nFile:07D44298-50DA-4218-BF5A-440677DC214B 4 5005 c.jpeg\nFile:1F1542DB-494C-49FF-B57E-947FAEFDA23B.jpeg\nFile:9351F126-391F-48A1-A2A8-689F2F5F478A 4 5005 c.jpeg\nFile:3D350723-7DD2-4AD1-A1A9-6E600F01E322.jpeg\nFile:F4E2DEE5-7331-4E00-B65D-377F4F9556B3.jpeg\nFile:58EB0395-9B4E-4F43-907D-56D7699C4ADA.jpeg\nFile:6A397ECE-C53D-4C3F-BF5C-1CDEE77A5D98.jpeg\nFile:6810FE99-C2E8-4D76-901B-598C940B83C5.jpeg\nFile:DE508FF8-BE7F-4AC5-83E2-A79A9C5F05F6.jpeg\nFile:FD766138-D518-415C-905E-5195244C2974.jpeg\nFile:871FBB07-F688-463B-B58B-47F8E5C3023C.jpeg\nFile:F4C562DB-AA2C-4E34-A41F-F7784D040C8F.jpeg\nFile:9C83BD1F-2E83-4873-A99A-3CB45E041180 1 105 c.jpeg\nFile:A987CC6C-31B0-4F12-AABE-6EADEB4D979C.jpeg\nFile:7460446B-82AB-454F-AD99-727103FBF302 1 105 c.jpeg\nFile:56867CA8-7E38-4FBA-A67F-67D71D800DA0 1 105 c.jpeg\nFile:85C5AF28-4F0E-485A-8802-1B81D1F92F5A 1 105 c.jpeg\nFile:59348A95-ED3A-4C2A-AEF7-0ADCB5948645.jpeg\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Needs work]]\n[[Category:Cute]]\n[[Category:Core Suffix]]\n[[Category:Feminine]]"}}}]}}}}
