Both go along with applying those concepts to one's self, as a way of getting back at the dehumanization society has applied to them.<ref>https://arotaro.tumblr.com/post/171677143816/milkchocolateowl-arotaro-can-you-elaborate-more</ref> While these are popular descriptors of the subculture, it is also up to the person's and community's personal perspective and experiences to describe Voidpunk.<ref>https://arotaro.tumblr.com/post/184933174181/the-bigger-voidpunk-gets-the-more-i-feel-like-it</ref> \n\nIt is exclusively for groups and individuals who face dehumanization from society.<ref>https://arotaro.tumblr.com/post/181649684596/sorry-to-bother-you-but-someone-brought-it-to-my</ref> Some groups included in that experience are a-spec people, nonbinary people, neurodivergent people, disabled people, and many more.<ref>https://arotaro.tumblr.com/post/177643285606/since-voidpunk-seems-to-be-gaining-some-steam</ref>\n\n\n== Visual ==\nMany voidpunk images use black, white, and cool tones like greens, blues, and purples, though yellows are sometimes found as well. Some followers of voidpunk create 'voidsonas', characters/designs that represent their experiences and personal concept of being voidpunk. Popular themes in voidsonas, as well as in general with the aesthetic, are space/aliens, robots/technological entities, glitching and distortion, mythological creatures/cryptids, extradimensionality, and the general feeling of something being Other. However, voidpunk has no one specific interpretation and is much more about how one approaches the concept through their own unique perspective and life experiences that allow them to identify with it.\n\n== Music ==\n\n* [https://open.spotify.com/user/4dhd9zqylmz0trayue4im7d9u/playlist/3nxKHb2MPzx36V25umzzRt?si=EXSNBothRumRfJagImXnrw voidpunk(but the cool kind)]\n* [https://open.spotify.com/user/ix4qi71qq1k0jokqcmjtk60lo/playlist/5AAfyHJVZJUSyWG9TiTTgc?si=J-oAYtGFSq65Fxb1Bi7mTA voidpunk/inhumanisme]\n* [https://open.spotify.com/user/relyuh/playlist/5qm7sBpySGss8JaJG9vV3L?si=xxrZIv6xQGO0jQYYibokDQ <nowiki>[\ud83d\udc8e]Voidpunk</nowiki>]\n*http://suan.fm/mix/Bk34JyuPG\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1r2qM04OZzCbupik4i89ph?si=ggZd1vwNRQ6FCEAed9NO4Q Edgy Skinwalker GF] by Lucy Morgenstern\n*[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMdaisTI5peR2ZZudbxThi9L2aR7QQAYs Voidpunk]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvdE5Dj_vIJKKjhgrAXbh67AGv9e4tWSY voidpunk]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3sIEE2eNHIAuIUFwS592vO?si=25b7404ce7db44ee \u00ff\u0334\u0349\u0301\u033ee\u0338\u0322\u0339\u0356\u0331\u0354\u030a\u030c\u00e0\u0335\u0322\u0330\u0318\u0347\u0125\u0335\u0318\u0307\u030a\u035d\u035d\u0345]\n\n== Community ==\n\n* [https://www.reddit.com/r/voidpunk/ /r/voidpunk on Reddit]\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery widths=\"185\" orientation=\"square\">\nMatthieu Cousin on Twitter.png\nArnaud de Vivi\u00e8s (@arnauddevivies).jpg\nEDA on Twitter.png\nNatalie hall on Twitter.jpg\nScreen Shot 2020-11-06 at 12.37.46 PM.png\nScreen Shot 2020-11-06 at 12.45.05 PM.png|aromantic voidpunk moodboards\nScreen Shot 2020-11-06 at 12.48.07 PM.png\nScreen Shot 2020-11-06 at 12.48.19 PM.png\nScreen Shot 2020-11-06 at 12.56.31 PM.png|a voidpunk image using vaporwave editing\nScreen Shot 2020-11-06 at 12.58.48 PM.png|glitchcore voidpunk\n8702d3645fcb8fe014b6167beda10da7.jpg|a black mask with two chains and a blue eyeball in the middle\nVoidpunk.png|Voidpunk flag\nScreen_Shot_2021-01-11_at_1.14.13_PM.png\nVoidpunk-11.jpg|I don't really feel like existing today.\nVoidpunk-12.jpg|No, I'm not human.
