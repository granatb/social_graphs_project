However, some have identified connotative differences between the terms.<ref>https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/geek</ref><ref>https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/nerd</ref><ref>https://www.dictionary.com/e/dork-dweeb-nerd-geek-oh/</ref>\n\n== Origins of Geek ==\nThe word 'Geek' comes from the English word 'geek' or 'geck', meaning a 'freak'; from Middle Low German 'Geck'. Geck is a standard term in modern German and it means 'fool'. The root also survives in the Dutch and Afrikaans adjective gek ('crazy' or 'bizarre'), as well as some German languages, like the Alsatian word Gickeleshut ('jester's hat'; used during carnival). In 18th century Austria, Gecken were freaks on display in some circuses. In 19th century North America, the term 'geek' referred to a performer in a geek show in a circus, traveling carnival or traveling funfair sideshows. The 1976 edition of the American Heritage Dictionary included only the definition regarding geek shows.\n\nThis variation of the term was used to comic effect in 1970s TV shows, such as Sanford & Son and Starsky and Hutch. In the Bounty Hunter episode of 1976 of Starsky and Hutch, stating that \"a geek is a freak in a circus side show, who is kept in a pit and they throw snakes and chicken heads at, and he runs around crazy and gobbles them up\", and \"in 1932 the geeks formed their own union\". In that episode, Starsky and Huggy Bear say they read this in an unreliable book. In it, there is a man shooting the head off a bumblebee in flight, and Big Foot, alluding to the apocryphal nature of who is a geek.\n\nProfessional wrestling manager \"Classy\" Freddie Blassie recorded a song in the 1970s called \"Pencil-Necked Geek\".\n\n== Activities ==\n* Playing video games (ex.

The glasses\u2014sometimes worn with non-prescription lenses or\u00a0without lenses\u2014quickly became the defining aspect of the trend, with the media identifying various celebrities as \"trying geek\" or \"going geek\" for wearing such glasses, such as\u00a0David Beckham\u00a0and\u00a0Justin Timberlake. Meanwhile, in the sports world, many\u00a0NBA\u00a0players wore \"geek glasses\" during\u00a0post-game interviews, drawing comparisons to\u00a0Steve Urkel.\n\nThe term \"geek chic\" was appropriated by some self-identified \"geeks\" to refer to a new, socially acceptable role in a technologically advanced society.\n\n== Music ==\n''Under Construction''\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery widths=\"130\">\n\nPlaystation (Geek).jpg|The first Playstation console, which was popular to the geeks in the 1990s.\nVideo Game on TV (Geek).jpg|Geeks playing Halo 2 on television. \nSurfing the web (Geek).jpg|The internet is one of the main hobbies of geeks.\nSplatoon (Geek).jpg|The Squid Sisters plushy dolls.\nDrawing (Geek).webp|A geek's drawing of X from ''Mega Man X''\nSquall Leonhart T-shirt (Geek).jpg|A geeky woman wearing a Squall Leonhart T-shirt. \nCosplay (Geek).jpg|A geek cosplaying as Frog from ''Chrono Trigger''\n1305825157411.jpg|The Hacker's Manifesto|A geek hacking a computer system, though hacking is actually more of a nerdy hobby. \nFile:Geek cave.jpeg| A collection of toys and Marvel posters.\nGeeks from Freaks and Geeks.webp|The Geeks from ''Freaks and Geeks''\n\n</gallery>\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Fashion]]\n[[Category:Visual]]\n[[Category:Needs work]]"}}}]}}}}
