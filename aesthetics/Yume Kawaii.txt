It appears like the embodiment of a \u201cgirls dream\u201d and you can find many illustrations, clothing, and goods, which incorporate this. Due to the nature of dreams, it can also feature nightmarish elements.\n\n\n\n==Fashion==\n[[File:Genres of Kawaii- Yumekawaii|thumb|left]]\nYume Kawaii fashion includes feathers, frills, ribbons, and other fluffy materials in its looks. The outfits usually consist of printed tops with a sailor collar, sheer jackets, poofy skirts or pants, loose socks, and platform shoes. Sleeping mask headdresses and pillow bags are also popular.  \n\nWhile [[Fairy Kei]] emits a vintage, retro kind of [[kawaii]], Yume Kawaii also covers many modern styles and features lots of motifs related to Japanese pop culture, such as magical girls, strawberry milk, and conpeitou. \n\nThe hair is often bleached and dyed to archive high tones like milk tea, pastel pink, and lavender, but wigs in fluffy styles are also very common. \n\nThere are many circle lenses, glitter under the eyes, and very pop impressions. And there is an important element: the \"sleepy\" look. People achieve this look by applying an excessive amount of blush under their eyes. \n\n==Art==\nYume Kawaii may have fairytale and cutesy motifs, but it also consists of nightmarish themes. And just like this style, there are photo and image edits that embody this pale cuteness and slightly sad poems. There are Yume Kawaii illustrations as well. One of the most well-known illustrators who represents Yume Kawaii is Kato Rei. He has released his first artbook, \"Girl Friend\" in 2015. It characterizes Yume Kawaii with its use of pale colors and romantic girly appeal. \n\n==Music==\nPopular idol groups within Yume Kawaii include:\n*[https://open.spotify.com/artist/4jkdKINcEZW4xu7bg8gZQZ Candye\u2661Syrup]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/artist/0Pn9eKty96tdakwQBYPWu7 CY8ER]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/artist/1NNzn1gQQvpMZIE8VIEp6a Ice Cream Yume Shoujo]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/artist/7jef26c16HijtnAO9U9TrY Senanan]\n*Strawberry Syndrome\n*[https://open.spotify.com/artist/2j00CVYTPx6q9ANbmB2keb Yunomi]\n\n==Resources==\nExternal links to help get a better understanding of this aesthetic.\n\n=== Blogs ===\n\n* [https://yumeh0lic.blogspot.com/ Yumeholic]\n\n===Vendors===\n\n*[https://shop.mst07k.com/ Conpeitou]\n*[https://lara-lovely.jp/ Lara Lovely]\n*[https://miraclecom.thebase.in/ Miracle.com]\n*[http://ponica.shop-pro.jp/ Nijiiro Ponic]\n*[https://www.pattys.jp/swimmer Swimmer]\n\n===Playlists===\n\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5M8rjGHzDsnrSBtSqPRcBU DREAMWAVE - OFFICIAL PLAYLIST (UPDATED) by Dreamwave]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2ry1eNMOfwOXJ1IZPuyOCa Dreamwave Spotify playlist by jokerfil]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3WRD7JC4s1FMYRR13XkIGd?si=ZQda48agQnGISZKeEcHoFg DREAMWAVE Spotify playlist by fe.iza]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2ezUCY2hZR6oAYxZvnQjhS?si=ZFspfT9KTbukcp4Lv-k3jw Yume Kawaii\ud83d\udcab\ud83c\udf28 Spotify playlist by 22rb23s2mdl4dtfdxqtroqtgi]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5P4asOu9pfDLc87zTK6Rrm \ud83c\udf6d\ud83e\udd21When you wanna put stickers on your face\ud83c\udf6b\ud83d\udc07 by Pholantasia]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4QVIIdUugxJ0g8vm2GkDQo?si=FYALx_-CQ2ihM3JU-x6hrA Dreamwave Spotify playlist by JNasty]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4WIDr9giDHlQs32cNWvNNq?si=D_s2EUmxQv64obDITu6hvA Dreamwave Spotify playlist by Rowan Easter]\n\n===Pinterest Boards===\n*[https://www.pinterest.com/zephyrinspiration/yume-kawaii Yume Kawaii by Yumelixir]\n*[https://www.pinterest.com/vnskald/yumekawaii Yume Kawaii by valentin]\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" orientation=\"landscape\" widths=\"130\" bordercolor=\"#EEBFFF\">\nPillow-bag.jpg\nEHCJw5YUcAA4Rog.jpg\nEZbdSc-UwAAvS0G.jpg\n027.jpg\nMagical-girl-syringe.jpg\n020.jpg\nYumekawaii-girls.jpg\nMagical-girl-weapons.jpg\nSailor collars.jpg\nYumekawaii gun.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n[[Category:Fashion]]\n[[Category:Visual]]\n[[Category:Japanese]]\n[[Category:Feminine]]\n[[Category:Cute]]"}}}]}}}}
