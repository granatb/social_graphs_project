Depending on the workplace, various levels of the formality of business attire are expected, and the norm. The dress codes range from traditional and formal to smart casual, business casual, and casual.\n\n== Visual ==\nA lot of modern Corporate visuals will draw loosely from the [[Cyberprep]] aesthetic (unless you're the CEO, where [[Boujee]] is almost undoubtedly the aesthetic of choice for you) in the sense it's very safe, sterile, and designed solely to motivate you to continue being a useful part of the corporate infrastructure, which can be smiliar to the [[Studyblr]] aesthetic, since it's believed by many that an aesthetically-pleasing workspace increases productivity.\n\nA lot of retro corporate aesthetics are often incorporated into the [[Hustlewave]] (unironically) and [[Vaporwave]] (ironically) aesthetics.\n\n== Fashion ==\nUnless it's a Business Casual (see below), most Corporate fashion will feature for men:\n\n* Button-Up Shirt\n* Tie\n* Dress Pants\n* Jacket\n* Belt\n*Dress shoes\n\nFor the ladies, however, there can be a little more variety:\n\n*Business suit with either dress slacks or knee-length skirt in a conservative neutral color.\n**Linen/cotton for summer months\n**Wool or heavier material for winter\n*Blouses\n*Dress shirts\n*Sweaters\n*Button-down tops\n*Turtlenecks\n*Natural-looking makeup\n*Closed-toe heels in a neutral color such as taupe, black, grey, or brown.\n*Formal flats, oxfords, or loafers\n*Minimalist jewelry\n*A-line, pencil, or flared knee-length skirt\n* Dark tights\n* Well-groomed hair worn in a conservative cut, such as a bob or soft layers.\n* Well-groomed, neutral nails that are either clear coated, or painted with a beige-toned polish.\n\nMembers of the [[Goth]] subculture that are part of the Corporate machine will incorporate the Corporate Goth aesthetic into their work attire.\n\n== Music ==\nA lot of corporate music is easy-listening, kinda jazzy, and instrumental.  A lot of Corporate-sounding music has been sampled to make a lot of Vaporwave music which, ironically, can also be part of the Corporate musical sound once more.\n\n=== Spotify playlists ===\n\n* [https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1IacqEpI9KPzo8FMP01P2u?si=9HjFeQudSHGG6g2KrZ0L1A Corporate Instrumental Music Spotify playlist by 1257625809]\n* [https://open.spotify.com/user/11183688818/playlist/0Ks8fXulEtZMxWxj8HFX9L Corporate Mornings Spotify playlist by Krzysztof Piwowar]\n* [https://open.spotify.com/user/1210901113/playlist/0JniNl00ZF8YfOBS7ZiES7 CORPORATE UPBEAT Spotify playlist by Robert Ruggiero]\n* [https://open.spotify.com/user/judy.gong/playlist/1LPxKxBNj4Hp2v0LRynMOt Corporate Event Pump Up Playlist Spotify playlist by Judy Gong]\n* [https://open.spotify.com/user/therealjono/playlist/7MwqJphbKCBy3ZUPmppDPc Corporate Finance & Chill Spotify playlist by therealjono]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4C6EOPlu6iTnfySrJJfNN9 Office Hell (Spotify playlist) by smallpoxlarry]\n\n== Media ==\n\n=== Books ===\n\n* ''The Mezzanine'' by Nicholson Baker\n\n=== Movies ===\n\n* ''9 to 5'' (1980)\n* ''Up In The Air'' (2009)\n* ''Office Space'' (1999)<br />\n\n=== TV Shows ===\n\n*''20 Things to Do Before You're 30'' (2002)\n*''The Office'' (2005-2013)\n*''Monday Monday'' (2009)\n\n== Subgenres ==\n\n=== Business Casual ===\n'''Business Casual''' is an ambiguously-defined Western dress code that is generally considered casual wear but with smart components of a proper lounge suit from traditional informal wear, adopted for white-collar workplaces.\n\n==== Fashion ====\nThe fashion of this particular aesthetic involves:\n* Khaki\u00a0pants\u00a0\n* Slacks \n* Skirts\n* Short-sleeved/long-sleeved collared shirts\n* Polo shirts\n* Long-sleeved shirts\n* Turtlenecks\n* Plaid Jackets (usually brown)\n* Dress shoes\n* Leather handbags/ wallets\n* Leather belt\n* Simple jewelry\n* Wool/Cashmere sweaters under collared shirts\n* Wristwatches\n* Leather or suede flats\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery widths=\"130\">\nCbdabc313f8408522bd48be605be4fe4.jpg\nF.O.W\n20+ Stunning Business Casual Outfits Perfect For Work In The Office.jpg\nCorporateAesthetic1.jpg\nCorporateAesthetic2.jpg\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Visual]]\n[[Category:Fashion]]\n[[Category:Music]]\n[[Category:Mature]]\n[[Category:Mainstream]]"}}}]}}}}
