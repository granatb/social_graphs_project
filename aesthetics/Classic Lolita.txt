Tea length skirts (skirts that come to the mid calf) are extremely common, with underskirts (a slip-like skirt with a lace ruffle at the very bottom) can be used to make a knee-length dress go to tea length.\n\nCoordinates often include heirloom details such as pintrucks and ruffles.\n\nUnlike other Lolita styles, flat shoes are very uncommon. In Classic Lolita, higher heeled shoes with straps as well as Victorian style boots are favored instead. \nThe hair in Classic Lolita is kept natural in various shades of blonde, brown, and black. The hair can be styled in any way the person prefers. There are some who curl their hair, but it isn't very extreme. Makeup is preferred to be kept natural-looking as to appear mature.\n\n== Visuals ==\nIn Classic Lolita, common themes are solid colors, florals and stripes. Equally common are prints featuring crowns, fleur de lis, crests, antiques, architecture and duplications of old paintings.\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery widths=\"185\">\nCountryloli.jpg\nClassicloli3.jpg\nClassicloli8.jpg\nClassicloli6.jpg\nClassicgirl.jpg\nClassiclolitaaaaaaaaaa.jpg\nClasscilolitaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.jpg\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Fashion]]\n[[Category:Visual]]\n[[Category:Feminine]]\n[[Category:Japanese]]\n[[Category:Lolita]]\n[[Category:Candidates for Deletion]]"}}}]}}}}
