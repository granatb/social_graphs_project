This applies to many location-based aesthetics across the world, and can include fantasy worlds as well. Among tourists, sociologists distinguish sunlust from wanderlust as motivating forces \u2013 the former primarily seeking relaxation, the latter engagement with different cultural experiences. Wanderlust may reflect an intense urge for self-development by experiencing the unknown, confronting unforeseen challenges, getting to know unfamiliar cultures, ways of life and behaviours or may be driven by the desire to escape and leave behind depressive feelings of guilt, and has been linked to bipolar disorder in the periodicity of the attacks. In adolescence, dissatisfaction with the restrictions of home and locality may also fuel the desire to travel.\n\n== Visuals ==\n\n* Buildings\n* Landscape\n* Lights\n* Sightseeing\n*Oceanscapes\n*Forests\n\n<br />\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\n\nFile:Journey-Aesthetic-Wanderlust-Journey-Aesthetic-Wanderlust-Aesthetic-vacation.png\nFile:Paris, Square du Vert-Galant, photographed by Claude Renaud, 1963.jpg\nFile:Seine, paris, 1949.jpg\nFile:Boujee-paris-window-heels-dress.jpg\nFile:Italian-wine-dock.png\nFile:Colosseum-italian-picnic.jpg\nFile:Typical American City.jpeg\nFile:D1970s-suburban-shops-fast-food-motels-gas-busy-clutter-signs-americana-DBXBCN.jpg\nFile:Rainy road.jpg\n\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Visual]]\n[[Category:Needs work]]"}}}]}}}}
