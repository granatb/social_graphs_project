An early example would be ''TRON'' (1982), which depicted a digital world with glowing lines and circles and partly inspired the [[Synthwave]] aesthetic. ''The Matrix'' (1999) is also notable for representing a simulated reality as green raining digital code, which became associated with computer hacking.\n\nAccording to designer Chris Noessel, the color blue became common in late-20th-century science fiction as it was associated with unnatural or artificial things.<ref>[https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/future-screens-are-mostly-blue/ Future Screens are Mostly Blue]<br /></ref> However, the use of this aesthetic in its current form to portray the concept of \"technology\" would not become widespread until the 21st century with the increasing popularity of the Internet and the influence of sci-fi anime like ''Ghost in the Shell'' and live action movies like ''Minority Report''.\n\nAbstract design motifs often described as \"high-tech\" include:\n\n* Glowing lines, usually blue or white (or glowing blue backgrounds)\n* Transparent or holographic touchscreen interfaces\n* Segmented concentric arcs and circles of varying thicknesses\n* Hexagons, a simple, yet advanced and efficient (higher area-to-perimeter ratio, and tileable) shape\n* Printed circuit board patterns, found in most electronic devices\n* Binary numbers, the basis of most digital signals and data, or other forms of computer code\n* Dots connected by lines, representing the Internet or connectivity\n* Concepts of robots or robotic body parts\n\nIn stock images, symbols such as locks (representing cybersecurity) or the shape of a brain (representing artificial intelligence) may be combined with the aforementioned motifs as well. The use of technology in business may be portrayed as a businessperson tapping a floating touchscreen with the associated design elements. By the late 2010s, some commentators considered this stock imagery to be clich\u00e9.<ref>[https://goldenspiralmarketing.com/insights/19-hilariously-bad-stock-photo-attempts-at-visualizing-tech/ 19 Hilariously Bad Stock Photo Attempts at Visualizing Tech]</ref><ref>[https://insights.dice.com/2019/08/02/cybersecurity-imagery-make-hoodie-free/ Cybersecurity Imagery: Can We (Finally) Make It Hoodie-Free?]<br /></ref>\n\nGraphical user interfaces like these only appear in science fiction (known as \"fantasy user interfaces\" or FUIs<ref>[https://www.subtraction.com/2016/06/02/a-conversation-about-fantasy-user-interfaces/ A Conversation About Fantasy User Interfaces]<br /></ref>), stock images, or in user-customized desktop skins and widgets using software such as Rainmeter. Most default GUIs of tech products today tend to lean more towards the [[Cyber Minimalism]] aesthetic, which is intended to be more simple and user-friendly.\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nHi-Tech-Platforms-Information-Services.jpg\nFuturistic_circle_circuits.jpg\nHi-tech-interface-54-4k.jpg\nHigh_tech_circles_binary_world_map.jpg\nhigh_tech_lines_and_circles.jpg\nFuturum.2020-Digital-Transformation-Index-1280x720.jpg\nAI brain.jpg\nEnablingdigban.jpg\nTechnology-impact-on-life.jpg\nSpeed-internet-technology-background.jpg\nHigh-tech-1014x507.png\nBlue-lattice-points-graphic-web1200x675.jpg\nGhost_in_the_Shell_cyberbrain.png\nAD_Police_1999_still.png\nCulture_Matrix_Code_corridor.jpg\nMinority_report_interface.jpg\nMinority_Report_circles.jpg\nTron-2-0_14.jpg\nIron_Man_HUD.png\nTRON_Legacy_Arena.jpg\nBlog-scifi-ui-header.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n== References ==\n<references /><br />\n[[Category:Visual]]\n[[Category:Electronic]]\n[[Category:2000s]]\n[[Category:2010s]]"}}}]}}}}
