If one wants to go for that [[Boujee]] or Hypebeast look, but don't exactly have the budget for the name brand stuff, the Shanzhai aesthetic might be a nice alternative, especially as the Shanzhai variants becomes more and more indistinguishable from the genuine article.\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery widths=\"130\">\nPizza huh 0621.jpg\nShanzhai.png\nIndexshanzhai.jpg\n33849804473 12490cc2b8 b.jpeg\nUnnamedshanzhai.jpg\nShanzhai20.jpg\nImageshanzhai.jpg\nCJUa-qNUkAACPuB-1uqpauq.jpg\n20141120-011831-4711019.jpg\nDREPM-THE-WOELD The-Shanzhai-Lyric INIVA Image-courtesy-the-artists-500x377.jpg\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Chinese]]\n[[Category:Visual]]\n[[Category:Fashion]]"}}}]}}}}
