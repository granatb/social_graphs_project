Farmers and ranchers within the community value tradition and conservative ideals, community, and hard work in their field. The aesthetic places great emphasis on practicality, with a range of activities and items originating from their work and landscape. The style is popular with many people throughout the United States, even if they are not farmers or ranchers, and has been used as a visual trope for weddings, settings for TV shows, and political propaganda. \n\nVisually, the aesthetic shares many traits with [[Western]], but there is no emphasis on the 19th century, adventure or lawlessness, and instead focuses on the idea of home and being settled within the farmer lifestyle. And unlike [[Cottagecore]], which romanticizes the countryside and uses feminine aesthetics, Country is a lived reality, even if some visual tropes are used to the point of excess. \n\nThe people who participate in this aesthetic are unlikely to be aware of the aesthetic community as a whole. The lifestyle has cemented itself among the American mainstream, with it being a theme of multiple home decorating magazines, clothing brands, and even personality types. It is a point of pride for many people to be a \"country girl/boy,\" as their culture emphasizes patriotism and values that are atypical for many modern cities.<br />\n== Visuals ==\n\n* Alcoholic drinks - usually beer, whiskey, gin and not \"classier\" drinks like wine and champagne\n*Burlap, denim, and gingham fabrics\n* Connecting with farm animals\n*Fields of wheat and corn\n*Guitars\n*Guns\n*Hay - hay bales and haystacks\n*[[Karencore|Karen]]-like imagery such as \"Live, Laugh, Love\" decorations\n*Mason jars\n*Pick-up trucks\n*Red barns\n*Tire swings\n*Wood decorations, especially themed around the American flag or their home state\n*Sunflowers\n*Horseshoes\n*Chickens\n\n<br />\n\n== Fashion ==\n\n* Plaid shirts\n* Blue Jeans\n* Camouflage apparel\n* Cowboy boots\n* Hiking/work boots\n* Baseball and trucker caps\n* Cowboy hats\n\n<br />\n\n== Activities ==\n\n* Animal husbandry\n* Canning, the process of storing foods in jars and cans\n* Cooking traditional comfort foods like chicken pot pie and biscuits\n*Hard labor such as chopping wood\n* Horseback riding\n*Hunting deer\n*Line and square dancing\n*Repairing and maintaining farm equipment and cars\n* Riding tractors\n\n<br />\n== Country Girls ==\nThe Country Girl blends this aesthetic with teenaged [[Girl-Next-Door]] manners and personality types, and are typically depicted as innocent, relatable, and kind-hearted. The aesthetics are a more traditionally feminine interpretation, and would not emphasize traditionally masculine activities as much and would instead focus on gentleness and beauty. However, they typically would be able to handle themselves in these activities as needed, and are quite experienced in animal husbandry and homemaking. \n\nCountry girls are typically teenagers, and storylines and aesthetics concerning them would focus around [[High School Dream]]-esque concepts of becoming independent from their fathers, first love, and experiencing the big city (and returning home.) These women are often [[Equestrian|horse girls]], and paragons of Southern white femininity. The best example is Taylor Swift's persona during the start of her career. \n\nThe aesthetic involves elements of Cottagecore and Shabby Chic. In addition to the rough-and-tumble aesthetics, there will be traditionally feminine tropes such as:\n\n* Fairy lights\n* Lace sundresses and camisoles\n* Love imagery such as diary entries, love letters, and confessions\n* Sunflowers and daisies\n\n<br />\n\n== Music ==\nThe eponymous music genre is the type of music that these people listen to. The country music genre is incredibly popular and has a rich history, which is best described by the [https://countrymusichalloffame.org Country Music Hall of Fame], an American institution that documents the history of this genre.\n\n=== Playlists ===\n[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DWZBCPUIUs2iR?si=JCPmvOwqTXuRAb8qMK0LQg Country Music 101: Country's Greatest Hits]\n\n[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6nU0t33tQA2i0qTI5HiyRV?si=-bLAeDcmRxeQ_ajkepwIKg Country Hits]<br />\n\n== TV Shows ==\n\n* ''Friday Night Lights'' (2006-2011)\n* ''Letterkenny'' (2016\u2013 )\n* \n\n== Movies ==\n\n* ''Field of Dreams'' (1989)\n* ''Flicka'' (2006)\n* ''Footloose'' (1984)\n* ''Walk the Line'' (2005)\n\n<br />\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery widths=\"185\">\nCountry pick up truck.jpg\nCountry windill.jpg\nCountry woman.jpg\nCountry music.jpg\nCountry cows.jpg\nCountry home.jpg\nCountry cat.jpg\nCountry barn.jpg\nCountry family.jpg\nWind go brr.jpg\n</gallery>Resources\n\n* [https://www.countryliving.com/ Country Living magazine]\n\n[[Category:Fields and forests]]\n[[Category:Visual]]\n[[Category:Fashion]]\n[[Category:Mainstream]]"}}}]}}}}
