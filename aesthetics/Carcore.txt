The 80's in particular has led to a lot of Carcore imagery turning up in [[Synthwave]] images (popular cars including the DMC DeLorean and the Lamborghini Countach). \n\nInfluence from the 90's often focuses on Japanese sports cars of the era. It is typically associated with ''hashiriya'', illegal street racers in Japan who pushed their tuned sports cars to the limits across expressways and t''\u014dge'' (narrow winding mountainside roads). This would popularized by anime and manga such as ''Wangan Midnight'' and ''Initial D'' as well as video games such as the ''Tokyo Xtreme Racer'' series. \n\n=== Sports Cars ===\nWhile a lot of modern cars (on stock), tend to be less on the aesthetically pleasing side and focus more on functionality, modern sports cars continue the trend of being not only incredibly fast, but also very aesthetically pleasing designs.\n\n=== Futuristic Cars ===\nA unique subsect of Carcore can draw focus on car concepts planned for the future, which can either be an indication on where the future of automobiles can go to or where the past of the time thought automobiles were going to go (even if the ideas didn't quite pan out the way they had intended).\n\n=== Unique Paintjobs ===\nA lot of cars can take on very unique paint jobs, popular among these being color-shifting paintjobs and ''itasha''; cars decked out with paintjobs inspired by [[Animecore|anime]]. Videos of color-shifting cars can be very popular on YouTube and Instagram.\n\n=== Dekotora ===\n'''Dekotora'''\u00a0or\u00a0'''decotora'''\u00a0(\u30c7\u30b3\u30c8\u30e9\u00a0dekotora), \nan\u00a0abbreviation\u00a0for \"decoration truck\", are extravagantly \ndecorated\u00a0trucks in\u00a0Japan. Commonly displaying\u00a0neon\u00a0or\u00a0ultraviolet \nlights, extravagant paints, and stainless or golden parts (both on the \nexterior and the interior), dekotora may be created by workers out of \ntheir work trucks for fun, or they may be designed by hobbyists for \nspecial events. They are sometimes also referred to as\u00a0'''art trucks.'''<br />\n\n== Media ==\n\n=== Anime & Manga ===\n\n* Initial D\n* Wangan Midnight\n\n=== Movies ===\n\n* Cars 1-3 (Pixar)\n*Fast and the Furious series \n\n=== Video Games ===\n\n* Need for Speed\n* Midnight Club\n* Tokyo Xtreme Racer (Shutoko Battle in Japan)\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery widths=\"135\">\nTruck.jpeg|Dekotora\n82184865f253538d8842085a7f1e2168.jpg|Synthwave Carcore\nCe4bc5a34e84efcbf31473edb44b4379.jpg|Y2K Carcore\nCar_miami.jpeg\nPink_car.jpg\nGreen_car.jpg\nClassic_car.jpg\nAir_car.jpg\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Visual]]\n[[Category:Core Suffix]]"}}}]}}}}
