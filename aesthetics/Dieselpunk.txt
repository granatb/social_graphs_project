Popular items within Dieselpunk circles include waistcoats, arm covers, hosiery, bomber jackets, zoot suits, wristwatches, goggles, overalls; basically, anything that would've been worn during the interwar period that Dieselpunk is designed to emulate.\n\n===Dieselpunk Fashion===\n*'''[https://www.violentdelights.co.uk/ Violent Delights]'''\n*'''[http://www.dieselpunkindustries.com/ Dieselpunk Industries]'''\n\n== Fiction and Literature ==\nDieselpunk literature takes place during the 1930s and 1940s.\u00a0The aesthetic is primarily utilized in books, like David Bishop's\u00a0Fiends of the Eastern Front,\u00a0Kevin Cooney's\u00a0Tales of the First Occult War,\u00a0Larry Correia's\u00a0Hard Magic: Book 1 of the Grimnoir Chronicles\u00a0and\u00a0Richard Kadrey's\u00a0The Grand Dark, but there are plenty of movies that utilize the Dieselpunk aesthtetic, such as Brazil, Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow, The Rocketeer, Iron Sky (which, being about Nazis, also falls into [[Fashwave]]), and even Captain America: The First Avenger could be considered Dieselpunk cinema.\u00a0 Dieselpunk is even adopted into video games like Fallout (which can crossover into [[atompunk]] at times), BioShock (which is probably more [[Decopunk]]), Final Fantasy VII, and Wolfenstein: The New Order.\n\n== Music ==\nDieselpunk music tends to draw heavily from the era, so there is a lot of jazz, blues, ragtime, cabaret, big band, swing, and bluegrass from the time, but two modern genres have grown to evoke the Dieselpunk aesthetic: Electro Swing and Neo-Swing. Electro Swing is a combination of Electronica music with swing music made popular by groups such as Caravan Palace, Good Co, and Tape Five. Neo-Swing, however, were bands that were designed to be throwbacks to the era of Big Band that started becoming really popular in the late 90's thanks to acts like the Cherry Poppin' Daddies, Lee Press-on and the Nails, Squirrel Nut Zippers, the Brian Setzer Orchestra, Big Rude Jake, and RPM Orchestra. However, thanks to Dieselpunk, these bands have enjoyed some continued success even after fading away from the mainstream eye.\n\n== Directions of Dieselpunk ==\nDieselpunk has various directions depending on which time period is focused on or oriented around.\n\n===0Dieselpunk variations===\n*World War One focused: tends to include more crude machinery and is comparably closer to [[Steampunk]].\n*[[Decopunk]]: focuses more on the Interwar Period and is in general more glamourous.\n*World War Two focused: shows more perfected machinery with welding lines inestead of rivets.\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery widths=\"130\">\n220px-Diesel Forces.jpg\nDieselpunk by hayenmill.jpg\nIndex123.jpg\nD.p\n</gallery>\n\n[[Category:Punk Suffix]]\n[[Category:Music]]\n[[Category:Fashion]]\n[[Category:Written]]"}}}]}}}}
