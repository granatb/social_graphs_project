Anything old, poorly made, broken, or just generally gross and probably not safe to be around could probably qualify as trashcore.\n\n== Visual ==\nCommon visuals associated with Trashcore are decaying/decayed buildings, trash, moldy scenery, old antiques, vintage artworks, and anything that could generally be considered trashy, destroyed, or hideous.  It can also feature animals commonly associated with trash (such as raccoons, opossum, badgers, rats, bears, and any other sort of animal that might be caught mulling around in people's trash) doing their thing in civilization.\n\n== Fashion ==\nTrashcore fashion is very similar to [[crustpunk]]. There isn't a sense of anarchy to trashcore, but ripped clothes that are either homemade or from the thrift shop are common. T-shirts with doodles or weird phrases scribbled on with marker is something you'll see in Trashcore. You'll also see a lot of references to opossums, rats, raccoons, and other animals who seem to thrive in [[Urbancore|urban]] and suburban settings.  It can also incorporate things such as ribbons, pearls, corsets, feathers, rosaries, discolored lace, worn-out silk, or anything that, many years ago, would've been considered in fashion but have been so worn down by time that it can't even be salvaged in even a \"[[Vintage]]\"-inspired aesthetic.\n\n== Music ==\n===Songs ===\n\n*\"Bad To The Bone\" (by George Thorogood & The Destroyers)\n*\"Wicked World\" (by Black Sabbath)\n*\"Last Living Souls\" (by Gorillaz)\n*\"The Court Of The Crimson King\" (by King Crimson)\n*\"Aluminium\" (by The White Stripes)\n*\"Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap\" (by AC/DC)\n*\"Floyd The Barber\" (by Nirvana)\n*\"Paint It Black\" (by The Rolling Stones)\n*\"Purple Haze\" (by Jimi Hendrix)\n*\"Immigrant Song\" (by Led Zeppelin)\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery orientation=\"none\" widths=\"130\">\n0ad76bd6-5fac-4753-bb69-9ab68b573708.octet-stream.jpg\nTumblr ow1rcbIUH21uxynreo1 1280.jpg\nTumblr pr0s1xooEE1s7eamy 1280.jpg\nTumblr pq83r6AbMK1s7eamy 1280.jpg\nTumblr inline p7fz98Plxr1sjclht 1280.png|It'd be funnier if it weren't true...\nTumblr pq69a1AbxN1s7eamy 1280.jpg\nRaccoon.jpg\nTumblr 5335ab7108369f42465d49121fcb169c 20933d74 640.jpg\nWeird little guys.jpg\nMush hunting.png\nBunn gurrl.png\nScreenshot 2021-01-23 at 5.25.46 PM.png\nScreenshot 2021-01-23 at 5.27.41 PM.png\nStinkcore.png\nMossbus.JPG\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Core Suffix]]\n[[Category:Fashion]]\n[[Category:Visual]]"}}}]}}}}
