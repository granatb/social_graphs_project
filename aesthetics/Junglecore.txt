It can also be related to exploring, and even researching or preservation of the jungle. Junglecore is also associated with creatures such as orangutans, Indian elephants, treefrogs, leopards, and many more. It is calming and exciting, natural and bold, practical and aspirational all at the same time. \n== Visual ==\nJunglecore visuals are very tropical and full of life. The visuals show the jungle's greatest qualities such as:\n\n* Jungle animals\n* Rainforests\n* Waterfalls\n*Dense tropical plants\n* Vines\n*Tropical flowers and fruits\n* Leafy trees\n*Large and Colourful Insects\n\n== Fashion ==\nThe fashion of junglecore could be divided into two categories. The first category would be of a jungle explorer, an individual who is a visitor to the biome and is journeying through it.\n\n* Khaki-Coloured Clothes, or Clothes made of Khaki \n*Natural/Sustainable materials such as hemp\n* Baggy Clothing with Pockets\n* Bags such as Fanny Packs, Satchels, Canvas Backpacks\n\n* Binoculars\n* A Sunhat\n*Bandana\n*Practical Hairstyles such as Ponytails\n*Minimal Makeup\n*Sunglasses\n*Hiking Boots\n*Loose button-downs\n*Loose shorts or hiking pants\n*Earth tones\n\nThe second category would be of someone who calls the jungle their home, and finds the jungle to be their comfort zone. They have lived there for many years. Due to the prevalence of animal motifs, as well as conservation and naturalism as prominent inspiring values for the aesthetic, cruelty-free, sustainable, and synthetic faux-items may be preferred for things such as teeth, feathers, etc.   \n\n*Dense botanicals and florals\n*Bright, dark and bold colors\n* Animal prints and motifs\n*Feathers\n*Floral, botanical, tropical prints\n* Animal Teeth\n* Wooden Beads/Jewelry\n* Brightly-Coloured Cloth\n*Vibrant Makeup/Face Paint\n\nNote: Cultural appropriation is morally wrong. Please do not copy the fashion of indigenous groups who live in any of the multiple jungles around the world. Instead, I encourage you to create your own designs, or buy from people who belong to the groups!\n\n== Activities ==\nPeople with this aesthetic like down-to-earth and calming activities, as well as adventurous, exciting, and socially-conscious ones such as:\n\n* Taking a nature walk\n*Naturalism\n*Foraging\n*An interest in botany/any tropical species\n* Collecting and caring for plants, especially tropical varieties\n*Documenting species of plants \n*Collecting insects\n*Documenting species of insects\n* Photography\n*Keeping a journal of natural observations\n*Hiking\n*Caring for animals\n*Conserving/Protecting natural areas\n*Canoeing \n*Bird watching\n*Climbing trees/sitting in trees\n*Waterfall hunting\n*\n\n== Media ==\n\n=== Movies ===\nMany movies take part in the Junglecore aesthetic, mostly from the adventure, action, fantasy/sci-fi and romance genres. Examples of this are: \n\n*''Tarzan  (franchise)'' \n*''Indiana Jones (franchise)''\n*''Jurassic Park Series (1993)''\n*''Jumanji (1995)''\n*''Atlantis: The Lost Empire (2001)''\n*''Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008)''\n*''The Jungle Book (2016)''\n*''Dora and the Lost City of Gold (2019)''\n*''Jungle Cruise (2021)''\n\n=== Music ===\n\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1hSTAQXl8unZrRKBNFzwmb JungleCore by esme]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfTilOmpke8 Relax Music - Tropical Night Bossa Nova] \n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIgya1ADwas&t=2395s The Garden |\u00a0 Lofi Hiphop Mix |]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/track/0G21yYKMZoHa30cYVi1iA8 Welcome to the Jungle by Guns N Roses]\n*Roar by Katy Perry\n*Rainforest Meditation\n*[https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPXZKkjVs-les0H_5FSoarGBaXSlivg4j Glass Animals - Zaba (Album)] \n\n<br />\n\n== Resources ==\n\n=== Pinterest Boards ===\n\n\n[https://www.pinterest.com/brentwoodgirlscotillion/welcome-to-the-jungle-outfit-ideas-girls/<nowiki>]</nowiki>\n\nhttps://www.pinterest.com/AnahiRZGG/jungle-aesthetic/\n\nhttps://www.pinterest.com/JustPeachy002/jungle-aesthetic/\n\nhttps://www.pinterest.com/beckzillla/junglecore/<br />\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery widths=\"185\">\nJungleae.jpeg\nOIP (3).jpg|Tiger\nOIP (2).jpg\nOIP (1).jpg\nOIP.jpg\nImages (58).jpeg\nImages (56).jpeg\nJungloecoreflower.jpg|picture from Pinterest\nJunglecoreoutfit.jpg|picture from Pinterest\nElephantjungle.jpg|picture from Pinterest\nEyemakeup.jpg|picture from Pinterest\nParrot.jpg|picture from Pinterest\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Core Suffix]]\n[[Category:Needs work]]\n[[Category:Visual]]\n[[Category:Fashion]]\n[[Category:Oceans and islands]]"}}}]}}}}
