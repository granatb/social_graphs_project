The name is derived from the store Cult Party which popularized that style, but the name isn't actually used in Japan. \n\nCult Party Kei is often confused with [[Mori Kei]].\n==Fashion==\nCult Party Kei is primarily a second hand/thrifted fashion. For colors it\u2019s best to go monotone, 2-3 colors. Most outfits are white or cream for the most part; red is also very popular. Usually faded colors are worn, but some pastels are used, especially for pink colors and nightgowns. Too many pastels can make an outfit look fairy kei, unless you add enough cpk accessories/touches. Quilts used for jackets and skirts and yo-yo accessories are usually very colorful though.  \n\nThe silhouette is usually slightly baggy/loose fitting, but with a slightly/loosely defined high waist (around your natural waist line or higher) but not with a tightly belted waist. Shirts are usually tucked under skirts/pants, but not always, and most of the time the neckline is high. Layering can be as few as a shirt, camisole, skirt or shorts and peignoir, or even just a shirt and a skirt, and up to however many layers you want.\n\nPoofy skirts are the most popular; tiered, ruffled, lacey, mesh, chiffon-y etc.\u00a0 Usually they are mid length or short; sometimes long ones are used though.You can layer skirts to add more volume if needed. Vintage nylon petticoats are very popular, short ones can be tough to find, but longer ones can be worn high for an empire waist effect, suspenders can be used to help keep the skirt up. Any skirt can be worn this way as well, manapyon does this often. Sometimes even pulling the skirt up to your armpits to make a dress style look can work. Gingham skirts and sort of kitchy country style skirts are fairly popular, especially in red. You can also do 90\u2019s jeans or slightly baggy pajama-ish looking pants, they\u2019re often rolled up at the hems. Jean shorts (cut off or with folded up hems) are used as well. Gingham pants are great too. Skirts can be worn over pants or shorts, especially short poofy petticoats.\n\nDefinitely the most well known aspect of CPK is the peignoir. However it is not necessary to wear a peignoir to have a cpk outfit. Pretty much any vintage robe or peignoir will work for CPK, transparent ones are the most popular. Cotton ones are nice too, and usually easier to find in thrift shops. They are most often worn as the outer layer. However, they can also be worn under a cardigan, under a sweater or shirt, you can use your suspenders to keep them around your waist, and you can also tie the ends around your waist. Bed jackets, nightgowns and camisoles can also add some nylon to your outfit to make it look more CPK. Nightgowns can be worn as dresses, transparent ones are worn over a top/bottom or an opaque nightgown.\n\nTights or thigh highs are almost always worn when wearing skirts or shorts. Printed tights are very popular, as well as semi opaque white tights. Lace tights are good as well. Black or white thigh highs are popular, either plain or with lace at the top. Printed thigh highs can work as well, ones like grimoire\u2019s are good, or ones with cherries, bows or hearts. Lace trimmed ankle socks are very popular and a really good item to have. In warmer weather you can wear just ankle socks to keep cool.\n\nMost often Rocking horse shoes and Tokyo boppers are used. Sneakers are also really popular. Platform converse and the Vivienne westwood wing platforms are sometimes worn as well. A lot of the The Virgin Mary girls wear thrifted shoes in a lot of different usually 90\u2019s styles. Mary janes, ballerina style flats, and most Lolita shoes are options as well. \n\n==Dark Cult Party Kei==\n[[File:Tumblr lrytkjniP91ql69i7o1 500.jpg|thumb|270x270px|An example of the Dark Cult Party Kei look.|alt=]]\n'''Dark Cult Party Kei''' is similar to Cult Party Kei, but with more of a focus on darker colors. It still follows a lot of the same rules laid out in Cult Party Kei, though with a different palette of colors.\n\n== Resources ==\nExternal links to help get a better understanding of this aesthetic.\n\n=== Communities ===\n\n* [https://www.facebook.com/groups/277680468983404 Facebook]\n\n=== Blogs ===\n\n* [https://dark-cult-party-kei.tumblr.com/ Dark Cult Party Kei]\n\n=== Vendors ===\n\n*[http://comyu.shop-pro.jp/ Comyu]\n*[https://www.etsuna-otsuka.com/ Etsuna Otsuka]\n*[https://www.instagram.com/freckleat/ Frackleat]\n*[https://www.instagram.com/gunifuni/ Gunifuni]\n*[http://haightandashbury.com/ Haight & Ashbury]\n*[https://menotokyo.thebase.in/ Meno]\n*[https://priere.fashionstore.jp/ Priere]\n*[http://shop.the-virgin-mary.tokyo/ The Virgin Mary] (former Cult Party)\n*[https://tokyobopper.ocnk.net/ Tokyo Bopper]\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery widths=\"130\" orientation=\"portrait\">\n3ebb43019bc78146a81d812ff9fb68b4.jpg\nB286c306c69297646ab513e411150c1c.jpg\nCult-part-kei-2.png\nCult-part-kei-3.png\nTumblr lmlsp4GZTu1ql69i7o1 500.jpg|Dark Cult Party Kei\nTumblr luqfagWoVH1ql69i7o1 500.jpg|It doesn't matter if you're black or white...\nSnap20110801 6 1.jpg|Even the boys can get it on the Cult Party Kei fun\nTumblr me64j71A8b1qdzasfo1 500.jpg\nTumblr mdo0ihlezK1rrl3q9o1 500.jpg\nTumblr m7emquv4FV1qfq7rto1 500.jpg|A rare look at the skeleton of a Cult Party Kei look\nTumblr lo9e0xKWTl1ql69i7o1 500.jpg\nTumblr lpwelcZjmf1ql69i7o1 500.jpg\nTumblr lw47b8Hl3U1ql69i7o1 500.jpg\nCult party kei.jpg\nTumblr cpk.jpg\n180865548 4114838001911156 2944461496261495538 n.jpg\n163850206_3989449507783340_8079501725193190689_n.jpg\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Kei Suffix]]\n[[Category:Fashion]]\n[[Category:Japanese]]\n[[Category:Feminine]]"}}}]}}}}
