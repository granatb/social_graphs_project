Please read at your own risk.''  \n\nThe '''Common White Girl''' aesthetic, also known as '''Basic White Girl''', originated in the early 2010s through black artists' observation and riffing. A Common White Girl is identified by her perceived love of Starbucks or Dunkin, wearing Ugg boots and yoga pants, a sense of shallowness, and a lack of authenticity. This aesthetic was created through a negative view of popular trends seen mostly adopted by white teenagers and young adults, and is often used as an insult to these demographics. This aesthetic is often used by major media companies when creating female characters to make them more relatable to a larger audience. \n\n== History and Philosophy ==\nArtists like Klymaxx and Kreayshawn are among the first to use the term basic bitch in music in the very late 00s and the early 2010s. This term and its variations are also used by influencers like Lil Duval and Spoken Reasons, and these pieces of art and media often described a basic bitch as \"uncouth, uncool, and inauthentic\". It's original meaning has a similar definition of the popular 80s derogatory word 'airhead' but adds another more complicated level of trend following and racial tones. This type of woman and its criticisms swiftly grew in popularity in pop culture, especially in hip hop music. Social media also ran with the criticisms of common white girls as images and old school format memes were shared and created. This popularization caused the term and its associations to be put under fire due to its insulting and shaming nature. Though the time it existed lived only between 2009 and 2016, the negative connotations of women following popular trends blindly lives on, although the terminology has evolved.  \n\n== Visual ==\n''Under Construction''\n\n== Fashion ==\nCommon white girl fashion is often associated with easily obtainable, comfortable items that are usually cheap to produce and cheap to buy except for key brands that are known by name like Ugg boots. Fashion is the main key factor in identifying common white girls and are one of the more criticized elements of the aesthetic.  Examples of the fashion include:\n\n* French and fishtail braids\n* Dyed blonde hair\n* Aviator sunglasses\n* Circle sunglasses\n* Hoop earrings\n* Cubic zirconia stud earrings\n** Multiple ear piercings\n** Silver and gold plated\n* Cross necklaces\n* Chunky sweaters\n* Infinity scarves\n* Casual button-up shirts\n* Crop tops\n* Solid color t-shirts\n* Graphic tees\n* Sweatshirts\n* Skinny blue jeans\n* Blue jean shorts\n* Yoga pants\n** Solid and patterned\n* Ugg boots\n* Riding boots and Chelsea boots\n* Converse, Keds, and Toms\n* Moccasins and Crocs\n* Strappy sandals and flip flops\n* Belly button piercings\n* Name brand purses available at local retail stores\n** Michael Kors\n** Steve Madden\n** Louis Vuitton and Gucci (knockoffs common)\n** Coach\n\n== Media ==\nCommon White Girls can be seen through various forms of media, both online and on the small and big screens. Many pieces of media are also associated with Common White Girls as this stereotype often follows the most popular shows and movies in recent times. Many of the listings are associated with Common White Girls at the time of origin, however, with the evolution of trends the associated media also evolves. \n\n=== TV ===\n\n* Big Bang Theory\n*Cable contests like The Voice, American Idol, and So You Think You Can Dance?\n*Cooking shows like The Great British Bake Off and Top Chef\n*Criminal Minds\n*Degrassi\n*Friends\n*Gossip Girl\n*Grey's Anatomy\n*NCIS\n*One Tree Hill\n*Pretty Little Liars\n*Riverdale\n*The Bachelor and The Bachelorette\n*The Bold Type\n*Vampire Diaries\n\n=== Movies ===\n\n* 10 Things I Hate About You\n*Bridget Jones' Diary\n*Clueless\n*Legally Blonde\n*Love Actually\n*Mamma Mia\n*Mean Girls\n*Pitch Perfect\n*The Hunger Games\n*The Notebook\n*The Parent Trap\n*The Princess Diaries\n*The Twilight Saga\n\n=== Music ===\n\n==== Artists ====\n\n* Taylor Swift\n* Beyonce\n* Fifth Harmony\n* Ariana Grande\n* Katy Perry\n* Adele\n* Drake\n* Justin Bieber\n* Mariah Carey\n* Kanye West\n*Halsey\n* 5 Seconds of Summer\n* One Direction\n* Luke Combs\n* Maroon 5\n* Any current Top 40 pop/rap artist\n\n==== Playlists ====\n\n* [https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6MG1Ux06w9148emdfZqman Basic bitch bops by Rylee Kinne]\n* [https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4fkcLHxjMkPdEalAYPcFEq BASIC BITCH BANGERS by Ali Burley]\n* [https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4vqVlmy6AlEvmxQPN43cic basic bitch anthems by Tallara Daldorf]\n* [https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3z1ACcF91LuXhCD3CTOYtf Basic Bitch White Girl Shit (hoe anthem's) by Jordan Love]\n* [https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4T1WzAAi1ZsABv5mDeRHfa BASIC WHITE GIRL BANGERS by Ayla Bennett]\n* [https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2y2f1uhjqZz6qqBSo5R2FF Basic white girl music by Wolfdog1309]\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery widths=\"165\" orientation=\"square\">\nBasic.jpg\nBwg-dog-filter.jpg\nBwg-pink-starbucks.jpg\nBwg-sunflower.jpg\nBwg-boots.jpg\nBwg-costume.jpg\nBwg-starterpack.png\nBwg-selfie-top.jpg\nStarbucks.jpg\nHOW TO BE A BASIC WHITE GIRL|Comedy Sketch circa 2017 about Basic White Girls\nCommon White Girl\nCommon White Girls\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Mainstream]]\n[[Category:Visual]]\n[[Category:Fashion]]\n[[Category:Youthful]]\n[[Category:Feminine]]\n[[Category:Basic]]\n[[Category:Music]]"}}}]}}}}
