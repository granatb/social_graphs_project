Due to the fact that there is a lot more variety to western animation compared to the relative uniformity of anime, there is room for multiple sub genres of Cartooncore to pop up. Cartooncore also is closely related to [[Nostalgiacore]] because many people grew up watching cartoons over the past couple of decades.\n\n== Fashion ==\nWith cartoons comes a lot of merchandise. Merchandising for cartoons were especially popular during the 80s, such as toys for He-Man, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and Transformers. Cartooncore people may wear shirts with logos and characters on them, and may have pins referencing a favorite show.  Other items might include:\n\n*Cartoon merchandise.\n*Bold colors\n*V-necks\n*Interesting clothes\n*Pixel-type aesthetic\n\n==Activities==\n\n*Watching cartoons\n*Doodling\n\n== Media ==\n\n=== Shows ===\nCartooncore shows will involve, you guessed it, cartoons.

Fashion includes Disney merch, jeans, and Mickey/Minnie Mouse ears or backpacks.
