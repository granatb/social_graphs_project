Because of this, female characters are often subject to sexist treatment, or are placed in non-consensual sexual situations. Characters of color, when they appear at all, are subject to slurs and stereotyping. \n\n=== Violence ===\nExtreme violence such as torture and gun violence is common in spy fiction.<br />\n\n== History ==\nThe oldest spy story can be found in the Book of Joshua in the Hebrew Bible. Spy fiction is generally associated with the World War Two and Cold War eras, but spying and secret agents have existed during many wars as well as in times of peace.\n\nSpies can work solo, as investigators for hire who report to the person who hired them, or be part of a larger organization. After the Cold War, the discovery of espionage training programs led to the appearance of spy schools in fiction.\n\nSpy fiction in the 1960s could be extremely serious, reflecting the fears of the public during the Cold War era or it could be humorous and lighthearted, in an attempt to push back against these fears. Humorous spy fiction often parodies more serious spy fiction with references to characters and titles which existed previously.\n\nIn the late 20th century, spy fiction began to be marked to children. Children's spy fiction is free from the violence and sexual content common in spy fiction created for adults.<br />\n\n== Visuals ==\n\n* guns\n* blood\n* poisons and chemicals\n* gadgets\n* maps\n* sports cars\n* fire\n*explosions\n* passports\n* a signature drink, such as James Bond's martini\n* abandoned and condemned buildings\n* airplanes, especially private jets\n* yachts\n* fictional technology\n* English manor houses and estates\n* castles\n* secret passageways\n* codes\n\n=== Typical Character Types ===\n\n* The Handler - can be a mentor figure or a figure the spy is trying to escape from\n* The Spy (sometimes called an Agent or Secret Agent) - always the best, unless it is a comedy. Then the spy is clumsy and clueless.\n* The [[Femme Fatale]]\n* The Gadget Expert - usually much younger than The Spy\n* The Love Interest. Can be:\n** A Femme Fatale\n** A Civilian\n** another Spy\n** an Enemy Spy\n* The Enemy Spy - a rival with similar or better skills than The Spy\n* The Civilian/s - innocent bystanders and sometimes providers of helpful information. Most likely to be seen shouting about their produce stand being knocked over after a chase.\n\n== Activities ==\nSpies have a large variety of skills which they can be called upon to use during missions. Many of these are associated with the lifestyles and aesthetic of the wealthy.\n\n=== Sports ===\n\n* Tennis\n* Golf\n* Skiing\n* Swimming\n* Archery\n* Hunting/Shooting\n* Martial Arts - Karate, Taekwondo, Kung Fu, Judo, Aikido, Jujutsu\n* Boxing\n* Sailing\n* Gymnastics\n\n=== Games ===\n\n* Chess\n* Cards: Baccarat, Blackjack, Poker\n\n=== Skills ===\n\n* Ballroom dance\n*Chemistry\n*Coding\n* Cooking\n*Disguise\n*First Aid\n*Knowledge of foreign languages and codes\n*Mixing drinks\n* Seduction\n* Wilderness survival\n\n== Fashion ==\nSpies often desire to blend in with their surroundings as opposed to standing out. Colors like black, gray, tan, brown, navy and green are worn in clothing. Layers are worn for warmth and for ease of disguise. Shoes are usually easy to run, jump, and climb in. Much of the clothing associated with Spy Fiction is inspired by spy movies from the 1960s, when characters wore black turtlenecks and tan trench coats. A trench coat and fedora hat is often used to symbolize a spy's disguise, although this outfit is so out of fashion in today's world that it would be a completely ineffective one.\n\n=== Tops ===\n\n* Blazers\n* Turtlenecks\n* Button down shirts\n\n=== Bottoms ===\n\n* trousers\n* jeans\n* skirts\n\n=== Accessories ===\n\n* scarves\n* umbrellas\n* briefcases and duffle bags\n*duel purpose items like pens with hidden cameras\n*[https://tacticlip.com/ Tacticlip] \n\n=== Outerwear ===\n\n* heavy coats for cold climates\n* trench coats\n\n=== Stores ===\n\n*[https://bonhomme.fr/en/ Bohomme] - replicas of the map scarves wore by spies during World War Two\n*Burberry\n*Chanel\n*[https://www.instagram.com/genasingapore/ GENA shoes]\n*[https://www.mrporter.com/en-us/mens/designer/kingsman Kingsman]\n*Louboutin\n*[https://www.magnoliclothiers.com/shop-by-genre-espionage-classic-c-105_108_125.html Magnoli Clothiers]\n*Rent the Runway\n*[https://www.etsy.com/shop/swingingchicksshop Swinging Chicks Shop] - replicas of Gabby's outfits from The Man From U.N.C.L.E.\n\n*\n\n== Music ==\nMusic in spy fiction covers nearly every musical genre from opera and classical music to pop and rock music. Classical music and opera is often associated with villains in spy fiction who are wealthy or who enjoy the aesthetic of wealth and luxury. If the spy fiction is set during a historical time period, popular music from the day is used. Extremely annoying or loud music can be played as a torture technique.\n\n=== Genres ===\n\n* Opera\n* Pop\n* Classical music\n\n=== Songs ===\n\n* A Man for All Seasons by Robbie Williams (theme from ''Johnny English'' movies)\n*I Wish I Was James Bond by Scouting for Girls\n*Skyfall by Adele \n\n=== Playlists ===\n\n* [https://www.tunefind.com/show/agent-carter Agent Carter Soundtrack]\n* [https://www.tunefind.com/movie/atomic-blonde-2017 Atomic Blonde Soundtrack]\n*[https://www.tunefind.com/show/turn TURN: Washington's Spies Soundtrack]\n*[https://www.tunefind.com/movie/the-spy-who-dumped-me-2018 The Spy Who Dumped Me Soundtrack]\n*\n*\n\n== Other Media ==\n\n=== Books ===\n\n* ''Kim'' (1901) by Rudyard Kipling \n* ''The Riddle of the Sands'' (1903) by Erskine Childers\n* ''The Scarlet Pimpernel'' (1905) by Baroness Orczy \n* ''The Secret Agent'' (1907) and ''Under Western Eyes'' (1911) by Joseph Conrad \n* ''The Man Who Was Thursday'' (1908) by G.
