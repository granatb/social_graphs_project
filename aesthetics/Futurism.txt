It emphasised speed, technology, youth, violence, and objects such as the car, the airplane, and the industrial city. This aesthetic helped influence Art Deco, Dadaist, and surreal art.\n\n== Visual ==\nOften is abstract and surreal design depicting industrial or wartime scenes like airplanes, factories, cities, cars, artillery, war casualities etc. They often use vibrant psychadelic like colors and has emphasis on sharp curves that form mosaic shapes.\n\n== Artists ==\n* Filippo Tommaso Marinetti\n* Giacomo Balla\n* Umberto Boccioni\n* Gerardo Dottori\n* Christopher Richard Wynne Nevinson\n* Gino Severini\n* Antoin Artaud\n* Luigi Russolo\n* Tullio Crali\n* Fortunato Depero\n\n== Fashion ==\nFuturist fashion (also known as \"fashion forward\") involves wearing \nthings that will soon become very fashionable. It usually strays away \nfrom normal trends in order to create a new one(i.e. avant-garde).\n\n== Music ==\nMusic often uses unconventional instruments that sound like machines such as noise intoners and often simulates industrial machinery especially cars and airplanes.\n\n== Plays ==\nFuturist plays were often unorthodox and often malicious towards the audience like putting glue on seats.\n\n== Politics ==\nFuturist figures often espoused the philosophies as with their art with many of them being pro-war, technological acceleration, and increased industrialization. Futurists were also against marriage, academics, and Christianity. Futurist politics also sadly interlaps with Fascism with one of the most influencial figures, Marinetti having co-written the Fascist manifesto and absorbed the Futurist party into the Fascist party. Although in the late '30s many Fascists considered Futurist art to be \"degenerate\" and started destroying it.\n\n== Subgenres ==\n===Aeropainting===\nA form of Futurism that focuses on airplanes and uses design philosphies of airplanes.\n\n===Russian Futurism===\nA version of Futurism from Russia that alligned more closely with cubist principles. Although the movement started dying out after the revolution of 1917.\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery widths=\"130\">\nZhkbe.jpeg\nNevinson-arrival.jpg|The Arrival (Christopher Nevinson, 1913)\nSeverini-plane-paris.jpg|Suburban Train Arriving in Paris (Gino Severini, 1915)\nNosedive-in-the-city.jpg|Nosedive in the City (Tullio Crali 1939)\nGratticielli-e-tunnel.jpg|Skyscrapers and Tunnels (Fortunato Depero 1930)\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Visual]]\n[[Category:Fashion]]\n[[Category:Music]]\n[[Category:Needs work]]\n[[Category:Art movements]]\n[[Category:Ism suffix]]"}}}]}}}}
