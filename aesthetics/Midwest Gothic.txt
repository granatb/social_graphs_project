Like many other Regional Gothic aesthetics, it originated and rose to popularity in the middle 2010s on Tumblr. Just to clarify however, This ain't Midwest life. The person who told you that lives in a studio apartment in a major city and wants to live the \"pure life\" without actually knowing what it is. The Midwest is city, town, forest, and cornfield, Expect Detroit, that place is Midwest Gothic in a city. All of this applies to [[cottagecore]] as well\n\nCommon themes found in Midwest Gothic works include the indifferent and mysterious qualities of nature, references to local folklore, exaggerations of Midwestern traditions, and a sense of isolation and disconnection, as well as poor weather and depressing lives.
