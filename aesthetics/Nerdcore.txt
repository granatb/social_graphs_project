The aesthetic revolves around 80s-2000s Video Games, Anime, Hentai, Manga, Japanese cars, and Weed. The originator of this aesthetic is claimed to be MC Frontalot.... might as well include it, but the true birth of \"anime rap\" started from various Soundcloud rappers back in 2010-2011. A notable Nerdcore pioneer being [https://soundcloud.com/sensei-ion Sensei Ion], bringing that wavy & stoned sounding rap to Nerdcore.\n\nThe pioneer of the whole \"Be yourself, keep it real and embrace nerdiness\" is [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lil_B Lil B], who inspired an entire generation of rappers (both mainstream and underground) to be themselves and rap about otherwise \"corny\" hobbies. This was way back in 2009 before the Nerdcore style was set-in-stone and rappers were still experimenting with Boombap & West-coast style beats.\n==Visuals==\nVisually, nerdcore is mostly cover-art for beats or songs, usually having a artist title & song name (obviously), with a background of nostalgic 90s anime, hentai, video game scenery, or 3D game levels. To accompany this wavy background, there sometimes can be characters/items from video games & anime slapped on top. The cover for this page being a great example!\n\nSimilar to [[Trillwave]], the visuals can also have emphasis on Marijuana, Backwoods, Beer, and other food, as well as classic aesthetics such as [[Vaporwave]], [[Old Web|Old Web,]] you get the idea. In some cases, the cover art may be Hue-shifted to add purple/blue to the image which enhances the \"wavy\" atmosphere to everything.\n\nSometimes artists also features anime-drawn versions of themselves, adding personality to the cover art.<br />\n\n==Music==\nNerdcore, as previously mentioned, is primarily focused on Japanese pop culture, more specifically anime and its manga, video games, waifus from them and other kinds of media, especially those that are X-rated. Video-games and Anime are mostly focused on the 80s-2000s era. This is present in Nerdcore songs.\n\nNerdcore rap features same-style beats from [[Trillwave]] with more SFXs added and less ambient & sad beats. Nerdcore beats usually feature samples from older video games & anime OSTs, notably from Dragon Ball Zero, Naruto, Final Fantasy, Shiki and more. Nerdcore songs '''don't''' '''always''' focus on the struggles of life, hustling, guns and drug talk, and more focus on the more relatable, relaxing aspects of living the \"Otaku life\". ''However'', they can include all of the above, just not as present as [[Trillwave]].\n\nTo better describe the lyrics of Nerdcore, here are various lyrics from a few songs to drive the idea and gist into your minds. \n\n'''<u>As said above, the lyrics are mostly NSFW.</u>'''\n\n\n'''[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB_vpIGnMr0&ab_channel=KayPakaBabyShiva Kay P - Sailor Fuku (PROD.

Nerdcore beats have also evolved as well, more drill-style & plugg beats started becoming popular in 2018 for Nerdcore songs VS. the older sounding \"rawer\" sounding beats which were popular back in 2011-2017. \n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"130\" orientation=\"none\" spacing=\"small\">\nHENTAIGODDESS.png\nShonenJump.jpg\nDoujinshi.jpg\nAnimazing.jpg\nDoujinshiFiles.jpg\nCLVDTHEBLVD.jpg\nTM33.jpg\nYVSHIMVB.jpg\nTivo.jpg\nIc3cold.jpg\nHEAVENS_FALL.jpg\n</gallery><br />\n\n[[Category:Sensitive Content]]\n[[Category:Core Suffix]]\n[[Category:Visual]]\n[[Category:Music]]\n[[Category:Needs work]]\n[[Category:Candidates for Deletion]]"}}}]}}}}
