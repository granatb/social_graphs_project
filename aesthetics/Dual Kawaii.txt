There is, however, a more optimistic side. It combines self-care, sensitivity, and charm into one aesthetic. It is both pessimistic and optimistic. This aesthetic is a form of healing, trying to find one's self, accept both sides of themselves and come to terms with who they really are. \n\nThe aesthetic can also reflect the dual and, often contradiction, of visual taste between light and dark. This can apply to many variations of aesthetics but is mainly centered around the ones listed.   \n\n== History ==\nDual Kawaii is an aesthetic created/identified by Pinterest user @starberrymilkshake on Pinterest.\n\n==Visual==\nTaking on a blend of black and pink cuteness. It reflects two split personalities and feeling pulled between both; one cute and peppy, one dark and pessimistic. It also consists of self-care mottos and cute designs.

There are two sides to this aesthetic; a darker, lost sense (which is more edgy), and a lighter side with pastels, cute styles, and a more happy, peaceful sense. \n\n==Fashion==\nThe clothing style of Dual Kawaii is open to interpretation, with elements of pink, black, white, and cute motifs, with sayings like 'I am not who I seem to be\u2019.
