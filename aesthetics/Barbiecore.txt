Barbiecore is the wholesome little sister to the more jaded, more adult [[Bubblegum Bitch]]. \n\nThe aesthetic also includes \"girly\" 2000s television series like ''Lizzie McGuire'' and ''Hannah Montana,'' which focused on middle class American families. These shows encouraged confidence, female friendships, and girl power. Other products produced for tweens and teens in the early 2000s, like LipSmacker, are also part of the aesthetic.\n\nImagery from a more upper class lifestyle created by the Barbie toy line and movies, which includes multiple cars, a private jet, huge house, multiple pets including horses, and a yacht, is also found in this aesthetic, especially when the items are pink.\n\n==Fashion==\nFashion takes inspiration from the mainstream styles for girls and women in the late 1990s to early 2000s. With fashion inspired by specific Barbie movies, there can be crossover with [[Surf Crush]], [[Equestrian]], [[Fairycore]], [[Princesscore]], and [[Western]] aesthetics. The cutesy graphics can cause a crossover with [[Sanriocore]] or [[Unicorncore]]. \n\n*Baby tees or crop tops (may include graphics)\n*Marabou feathers\n*Low-rise jeans\n*Belly-chains\n*Miniskirts\n*Velvet track suits\n*Tennis skirts\n*Faux fur coats and jackets\n*High heels\n*Ugg boots\n*Knee high boots\n*Athletic sneakers\n*Tennis shoes\n\n===Accessories===\nBarbiecore accessories include:\n\n*Expensive plush clothing and shoes\n*Animal prints varying in shades\n*[[Pink]] and [[purple]]\n*Clear and [[Holosexual|holographic]] accessories\n*Heart shaped sunglasses\n*Tiny purses or shoulder bags\n*Plastic hair clips and jewelry\n\n===Makeup===\nBarbie is most often depicted as a white woman with blonde hair and blue eyes. People who do not naturally look like this sometimes wear a blonde wig and blue contact lenses to be more recognizable as Barbie.\n\n*Lipgloss\n*Brightly colored nail polish\n*Glitter makeup like eyeshadow and nail polish\n*False eyelashes\n\n===Websites & Stores===\nClothes from the 90s and early 2000s can easily be found on websites like Ebay.
