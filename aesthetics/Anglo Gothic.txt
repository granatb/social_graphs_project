Works that fall under this category tend to explore the themes of class, industrialism, and feature English staples such as cheap tea and biscuits. \n\nOther common themes are the hardships of labour occupations such as coal or steel mining and factory work that are common among those in the working class in England. A lot of Anglo Gothic media is influenced by the boom in council estates being built in the 1960s in England, hence a lot of imagery being evocative of that time.\n\n==Visuals==\nAnglo-gothic envisions run down British suburbs (which mainly have terraced homes that are falling apart or shoddily built apartment buildings). Some other aspects are broken cars from the '90s and early '00s and cloudy or rainy days.\n\n=== Pinterest Boards ===\n[https://www.pinterest.com/mariecat71725/anglo-gothic/ Anglo Gothic by Maggie.M]\n\n==Music==\n[[File:Anglogothic.jpg|thumb|170x170px]]Some music that falls under the Anglo Gothic category includes:\n\n*Arctic Monkey's music, particularly the albums 'Favourite Worst Nightmare' and 'Humbug'\n*Kaiser Chiefs' music, particularly 'I Predict a Riot'\n*Cage the Elephant, particularly 'Cigarette Daydreams'\n*'Chelsea Dagger' by The Fratellis\n*'Foundations' by Kate Nash\n*'Untrue' by Burial\n*'Say Hello, Wave Goodbye' by Soft Cell\n*'Bittersweet Symphony' by Verve\n*The Killers music, particularly 'Mr Brightside'\n\n==Films and Television==\nAnglo Gothic media is distinct from traditionally Gothic media set in England due to its grounding in more modern times as well as its emphasis on industrial towns and council housing, which became more prominent in the 1960s.\n\n=== TV Shows ===\n\n*''Alex Rider'' (2020)\n*''BBC Sherlock'' (2010-2017)\n*''C.B.
