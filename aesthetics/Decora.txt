It first appeared in the mid-90s due to the increasing popularity of the Japanese singer Tomoe Shinohara among teens.\n\n==Decoden==\nDecoden (\u30c7\u30b3\u30c7\u30f3) originally refers to the excess decoration of mobile phone cases, but has expanded beyond the original meaning over the years and can refer to anything over-the-top decorated with cabochons. It is very popular among Japanese girls in their teens to late 30s.\n\n==Fashion==\nThis style can be combined with pretty much any clothing but the most popular base fashions are [[Pop Kei]] and [[Fairy Kei]]. The outfits combine casual clothes with many layers in the form of multiple hair clips, bracelets, tulle skirts, stockings, leg warmers, and pins. Face stickers are very common to be worn with colorful make-up that matches the clothing. Wigs of unnatural colors may be worn. Clothing may have many prints, such as colorful prints, heart prints, and many other patterns. \n\n==Music==\nArtists incorporating Decora include:\n\n* [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRsP6Yv8qTzHf7ZgooCFYSw/about Rainbow Panic]\n\n==Subgenres==\n===Black Decora===\n'''Black Decora''' (also called '''Kuro Decora''') is nearly visually identical to Decora, but with the obvious exclusion of the bright colors. The accessories used in Black Decora often lean towards skull and gothic motifs.\n\n===Pink Decora===\n'''Pink Decora''' is another subtype of Decora that uses mainly pink, as the name suggests. Very small pieces of other colors can be used, but the color scheme is always mostly pink.\n\n== Resources ==\nExternal links to help get a better understanding of this aesthetic.\n\n===Vendors===\n\n*[https://acdcrag.com/en ACDC RAG]\n*[https://candytrap.storenvy.com CANDY\u2606TRAP]\n*[http://decopanic.com/ Decopanic]\n*[https://www.delishbeads.com Delish Beads]\n*[http://galaxxxy.joe-inter.co.jp/ Galaxxxy]\n*[https://harddecora.com Hard Decora]\n*[https://www.incontrolclothing.com In Control Clothing]\n*[https://www.store.miss-octopie.com Miss Octopie]\n*[https://mokuyobi.com/ Mokuyobi]\n*[https://www.mrwacko.me Mr. Wacko]\n*[https://nue-zzz.stores.jp/ NUE ZZZ]\n*[https://www.tokidoki.it Tokidoki]\n*[https://6dokidoki.com 6%DOKIDOKI]\n\n===Playlists===\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/70bHVi8NcTFXlbeKrW4cby Decora Kei by Lars Casler]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6dl5h1ZTWLl81oNCuitXog chaotic decora kei by ahocamilla1]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6ZTo0yQSSB44qk96DoxGDz decora kei vibes by lfargo77]\n\n==Gallery==\n===Decora===\n<gallery widths=\"135\" orientation=\"square\" spacing=\"small\">\nEyD26QjU4AME8rq.jpg large.jpg\nKurebayasi1.jpg\nCoordisnap-83279-593473-8xkcw9.jpg\nDecoden.jpg\nMig.jpg\nDecora-kei(2).jpeg\n263978576011202.jpg\nDecora-kei.jpeg\nTumblr nmre8oNee61qm9g2zo1 500.jpg\nDecora-kei(3).jpeg\nFile:Sebastian masuda 243497511 695441558515866 1748088693597972715 n.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n===Black Decora===\n<gallery widths=\"130\" orientation=\"square\" spacing=\"small\">\nBlackDecora.png\nDarkdecoraaa.png\nDarkdecora.jpg\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Fashion]]\n[[Category:Japanese]]\n[[Category:Needs work]]\n[[Category:Feminine]]\n[[Category:Cute]]"}}}]}}}}
