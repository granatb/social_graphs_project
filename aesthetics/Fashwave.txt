It's not unusual for people from the Fashwave scene to try and assimilate into the more \"mainstream\" Synthwave or Vaporwave scenes, but they are often sniffed out pretty quickly and given the boot because nobody wants to associate with actual Neo-Nazis.\n\nFashwave is just an extension of the alt-right, an amalgamation of various far-right groups such as Neo-Nazis, Neo-Confederates, skinheads (nothing to do with the [[Skinheads]] aesthetic), white nationalists, white supremacists, and other like-minded individuals in an attempt to establish a wholly white ethnostate by any means necessary (though they'll never actually admit it because they know their actual worldview is highly unpopular these days).  For more information on how the alt-right operate, please check out the video in the gallery below entitled \"The Alt-Right Playbook: How to Radicalize a Normie\"; it's a long video, but it can really show how they're able to recruit otherwise-normal people and highlights why they decided to create Fashwave (as well as infiltrate the [[Cottagecore]] community).\n\n== Visual ==\nFashwave art takes the overall visual aesthetics associated with Synthwave and Vaporwave and combines them  with symbols often associated with white nationalism, white supremacy, and fascism. What can make Fashwave more intricate, however, is the fact it can be claimed to be done \"ironically\", taking cues from the ambiguity often associated with Vaporwave.  When people don't buy the \"irony\" argument, they try to hide it by using more subtle imagery that laypeople may not necessarily know are Neo-Nazi symbols (such as the Schwarze Sonne, which you can see in some of the images featured on this page, including the Infobox image on the right), the Iron Cross, 14/88 (the 14 stands for the 14 Words, a popular white supremacist slogan and the 88 stands for HH or Heil Hitler), the Rounded Celtic Cross, the SS lightning bolts, the \"echos\" (a set of 3 parenthesis that they'll often use in reference to Jewish people), and ancient Runic symbolism, as well as utilizing phrases such as \"Reject Modernity, Embrace Tradition\", \"Blut und Ehre\" (German for Blood & Honor), and the 14 Words proper (\"We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children\" or the less-common \"Because the beauty of the White Aryan woman must not perish from the earth.\").  For more information on potential symbology often used by members of the Fashwave scene (or the alt-right in general), please refer to [https://www.adl.org/hate-symbols this useful page provided by the ADL].\n\n== Fashion ==\nWhile the original Nazis had ties to Hugo Boss and Coco Chanel (style icons of the time and Chanel itself has only become more popular as time has progressed), the Fashwave crowd doesn't really have an established fashion style and will often look normal and unassuming, if not a bit dapper in some instances (like with Richard Spencer, the man who coined the term \"alt-right\" who appeared to be a respectable white nationalist until he was recorded during a particularly unhinged rant about Jewish people and all enemies to the alt-right.  There could be considered some crossover into the [[Incel]] community (since often times, members of Fashwave or other alt-right communities will reach out to these people and attempt to recruit them into their numbers), but other than that, a lot of official Fashwave fashion aesthetics could tie into [[Nazi Chic]] territory, but rather than it being done as a statement to offend and shock, it's a genuine attempt at promoting their values.\n\n== Music ==\nFashwave music, at first hearing, may not sound any different compared to normal Synthwave music. However, one will be able to pick out subtle differences between the two, which can range from simple marching sounds to speeches by well-known fascists, white nationalists/supremacists, and other far-right individuals. Another key difference between the two is there isn't really any sense of experimentation in Fashwave music (leading to a lot of accusations of it sounding low effort and lazily produced; almost like the music is an afterthought).  Its rival, [[Laborwave]], however, has had similar criticisms against its music as well, so it isn't exclusively a Fashwave critique. \n\nFashwave has been compared to the Oi! movement of the early '80s, which was a far-right, neo-Nazi derivative of [[punk]] music (even though Oi! did not initially start off as that but it was rather co-opted by the Nazis... similar to how Fashwave was an attempt to co-opt Synthwave), and to \"Viking metal\" in the '90s, both of which fell out of style very quickly.  It came about after Richard Spencer had attempted to label 80's group Depeche Mode as \"the soundtrack of victory for the alt-right\", to which the members of Depeche Mode vehemently shot him down and not appropriate their music for his hateful cause (Depeche Mode's politics, for the record, do seem to skew more towards the Left), to which he moved on to trying to co-opt Synthwave music (which was gaining traction at the time), but after several prominent members of the Synthwave community publicly disavowed the alt-right attempting to co-opt their music (most famous among them being Robert Parker in a [https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2016/dec/14/fashwave-synth-music-co-opted-by-the-far-right write-up done by The Guardian]), they opted instead to create Fashwave (with musical acts such as Xurious being probably the most well-known of them.  Other musical artists in the genre have names like CYBERNAZI and 8841, which is just 1488 backwards), where they largely keep in their little sphere of influence although some will attempt to integrate into the Synthwave and Vaporwave communities, but once their white nationalist beliefs come to light, they often get cut off completely from the more mainstream communities once this information.\n\nA smaller sub-sect of Fashwave, called Trumpwave, as the name implies, focuses on Donald J. Trump, the 45th president of the United States. It has the same aesthetics as Fashwave, but with a focus Trump (which does tend to mesh in better with the 80's-inspired aesthetics than the fascist imagery often used, since Trump's rise to fame was in the 80's and, in many ways, one could say he was the definitive symbol of 80's excess).  This will often coincide with references to his campaign slogan \"MAGA\" (Make America Great Again) as well as the red hat that has come to symbolize the MAGA mantra.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"130\">\nZhnjjj.jpeg\nFashwave example.jpg\n31c.png|An quintessential example of Fashwave aesthetics at their most subtle.\n1484931787748.png\nDcczni2-8d594d82-c566-44b8-a8b7-e9b0c2b9f5cd.png\nTumblr pt986kqPFg1wt9kcn 400.jpg|A parody example of Fashwave visual aesthetics\nRevolt Against the Modern World|One of the more popular songs in the genre and a perfect example of the Fashwave musical style.\nThe Alt-Right Playbook- How to Radicalize a Normie|While not directly tied to Fashwave itself, this is an important video to highlight just how the alt-right operates and why Fashwave is even a thing in the first place.
