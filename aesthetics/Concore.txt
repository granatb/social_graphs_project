The prefix comes from the word con, which is short for \u201cconfidence trick.\u201d The core element of a con is convincing people that someone or something is other what it is in reality and is usually done for monetary gain. Concore aesthetics frequently appear in espionage, crime, and detective media.\n\nConcore experienced revival beginning in the 2010s, with social media influencers using photography tricks and editing software like Photoshop to appear thinner and healthier in an effort to earn commission on untested products.<br />\n\n== Subgenres of Concore ==\n\n=== [[Heistcore]] ===\nThe aesthetic of those who create and carry out elaborate plans to steal art, money, and jewels.\n\n== Criticism ==\n\n=== False sense of Anti-Capitalism ===\nStealing from large corporations is often justified as an anti-capitalist protest. In reality, most large corporations are far too wealthy to feel the pain of large thefts and the blame for the theft falls on employees, who can lose their jobs.\n\n=== Theft of the \"wrong\" things ===\nSome critics believe that the skills of hackers and thieves should be utilized to benefit a social majority, such as erasing student loan debt or medical debt.\n\n=== Privacy Concerns ===\nData hacks expose personal information such as medical history and credit card numbers to thieves. The exposure of personal information of minors is of special concern.\n\n=== Vigilante Justice ===\nThieves sometimes justify their actions as a way of getting back at a high powered politician or member of the wealthy elite. Many members of the general public feel that justice should be carried out in the court of law, as the fear and violence instigated by the conmen can outweigh the crime they are accused of committing.<br />\n\n== Fashion ==\nA good con artist is capable of blending in, fitting in or standing out, as the occasion demands. Clothing is appropriate to the class, culture and ethnic background of the persona the con artist is portraying and often relies on stereotypes. A female con artist can sometimes take on a [[Femme Fatale]] persona.\n=== Black Tie ===\n\n* ballgowns\n*suits\n*jewels\n*fur coats\n\n=== Ethnic Dress ===\n\n* hijabs, burqas\n*saris\n\n=== Uniforms ===\n\n* law enforcement\n*servants and waiters\n*school uniforms\n*lab coats\n\n=== Religious dress ===\n\n* nun's and monk's clothing\n*priest's clothing\n\n=== Makeup and Prosthetics ===\n\n* fake noses and ears\n*scars, birthmarks, and freckles applied with makeup\n*fake tattoos\n*fake piercings\n*wigs, hairpieces, and bald caps\n\n=== Stores ===\n\n*[https://www.bagborroworsteal.com/ Bag Borrow Or Steal]\n*[https://metalmastersco.com/ Metal Masters Co.]\n*[https://www.renttherunway.com Rent the Runway]\n\n== Activities ==\nCon artists generally engage in illegal activity, but they have many skills which can be useful or fun for ordinary people.\n\n* Editing photos in Photoshop\n*Genealogy\n* Lock picking on locks at home\n* Magic tricks\n* Makeup transformations and cosplay\n* Painting\n\nThere are also some activities that ''feel'' like cons because society has conditioned us to behave in certain ways.\n\n* Cooking copycat recipes\n*DIY furniture projects, often called Ikea Hacks\n*donating to [https://ripmedicaldebt.org/ RIP Medical Debt]\n\n== Media ==\n\n=== Books ===\n\n*''Au Revoir, Crazy European Chick'' by Joe Schreiber\n*''Call Down the Hawk'' by Maggie Stiefvater\n*Heist Society series by Ally Carter\n*''Oliver Twist'' by Charles Dickens\n*''The Disreputable History of Frankie Landau-Banks'' by E.
