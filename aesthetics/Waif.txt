Largely, \"nepotism girls\" (female celebrities who got to their fame via nepotism), models, ballet dancers, and rebellious boarding school students are examples of these types of characters.   \n\nArguably, it can be seen as a continuation of Heroin Chic, and it was influenced by [[Dark Nymphet]], [[Fairy Grunge]], and the humor of the podcast ''The Red Scare''. In addition to aesthetic images, much of this information comes from memes, whisper confessions, and text posts of things happening within their personal lives.  \n\nWhat distinguishes this aesthetic from the previous aesthetics above is the persona of these bloggers. Rather than portraying themselves as delicate and broken, they put on a confidence and rudeness that shows independence and openness. Specifically, the memes and text posts produced have a flippant or egocentric tone. However, these girls are using it as an expression of their mental illness. In addition to the glamour of independent and precocious lives of parties, money, and influence, there are multiple references to drug use, depression, and the desire for gaining attention from their looks.      \n\n==History==\n''This article is under construction''\n\nThis aesthetic first appeared in 2020 on Pinterest, accounts who have had this aesthetic usually have boards dedicated to whispers, certain aesthetics and horror shows.\n\n== Philosphy ==\nThe girls who participate in this aesthetic have a preoccupation with becoming beautiful through becoming skinnier, having attractive clothing, and projecting an attitude resembling a desirable and confident person. The reason for this is that they recognize the social rewards for being so. The aesthetic's alternate name, \"female manipulator,\" proves this, and through being determined to lose weight, multiple benefits such as modeling contracts (and thus, money)<ref>Image of an unattributed quote. \"Sure, we had to be skinny...But I made a million dollars by the time I was 20...Does that make me a victim?\"http://web.archive.org/web/20211203035119/https://morgueheart.tumblr.com/post/660609471798706176</ref>, being let into parties, being given free things by admirers, etc. could happen. \n\n== Visuals ==\nImages of '''glamorous types of people''' are one of the most common photo subjects. These are women who carry across the energy of this aesthetic in that they are '''beautiful but have an unapproachable and cold aura about them'''. Thin, with either blas\u00e9 or cheeky expressions, and unglamorous clothing are their common qualities. Supermodels, often Devon Aoki, Anya Taylor Joy, Kate Moss, and Lily Rose Depp in candid photos with unprofessional lighting and grimy environments are popular.   \n\n'''Fashion images''' are the next most popular subject. Runway details, designer storefronts, shopping bags, and cosmetics showcase the beauty of these girls and the aspirational lifestyle they have.     \n\n'''Ballet''' is another important visual, specifically those of ballet academies in Russia. Rather than images of performances with full costumes, however, these images always take place during class or independent practice. The colors associated with class uniforms and the setting: black, off-white, pale pink, and gray, fit the color palette. Images of \"what's in my bag\" for ballet students are also popular; pointe shoes, ipods, towels, magazines, etc. arranged haphazardly are common. \n\nBuilding off from above, '''Russian culture''' is frequently referenced in fashion (fur hats), literary tastes, memes about ballet, and whispers expressing the desire to move to the nation. The stereotypical image of a Russian woman: conventionally attractive, thin, pale, blonde-haired, and blue-eyed and the fact that Dasha Nekrasova, the more popular host of ''The Red Scare'' podcast, is from Belarus would contribute to this admiration. \n\nThere are frequent references to having '''cigarettes and black or iced coffee''', which are substitutes for food that have connotations associated with sophistication. Likewise, '''canned diet coke''' is another common photo subject and a reference to anorexics. '''Schnapps and vodka, especially cherry-flavored''', refer to the Lana del Rey song \"This is What Makes Us Girls,\" Russia fixation, and party lifestyle that these girls strive for.       \n\n'''Catholic school imagery''' is also popular. Schoolgirls in uniform, nuns, Bibles, and rosaries often appear as visuals. In whispers and text posts, these young women regularly joke about their Catholic upbringing, such as the religious trauma they experienced and the inside jokes that comes with living through similar life experiences. \n\nSimilarly, '''prep school''' in general is often referenced. Images of Rory Gilmore and other fictional characters or celebrities in school uniforms reading and holding books of high literary merit are common. '''Literature''' is celebrated, with books by Sylvia Plath, Dostoevsky, and the Bronte sisters appearing in memes and bookshelf images. \n\nOne of the main modes of conveying this aesthetic are '''whispers''', which are from an app of the same name. In them, users have to overlay a confession over an image. Waifs use imagery that matches the aesthetic, and text that communicates the typical thoughts relating to the characteristics of a waif. '''Word salads''' are fairly common, and describe the aesthetic in an overwhelming, chaotic way that mimics some prose of authors that these women read. \n\n'''Slogans and a shared vocabulary''' are also incredibly repeated in this community. Some of them may include:\n\n*\"Gaslight, gatekeep, girlboss\"\n*I'm like (toxic male fictional character, songs, objects, etc.) but a girl\n*God's favorite\n*In my (word salad, fictional character, songs, etc.) era\n*Using brunette and blonde as personality traits\n*The feminine urge to...\n*femcel, -pilled and trad, which originate from 4chan reactionary communities\n*References to spirituality, such as angel numbers and zodiac signs\n*[Blank] girl autumn/winter, a variation on the phrase [[Christian Girl Autumn]], which itself is a variation on \"hot girl summer\"\n* Some words include: girlblogger, delusional, waif, female manipulator, cunt, \"skinny\" as a superlative adjective, and slurs such as \"retard\" and \"faggot\"\n\n[[File:The cut edit.jpg|thumb|An example of an edit done to make it look like an article from ''The Cut'', which uses this distinctive title font and quip-y subtitles.]]\n'''Edited screenshots of news articles from the digital magazines ''Vulture'''''  '''and ''The Cut''''' are common, where, instead of a fashion/cultural title, the magazine would \"report\" on the mundane activities of a \"girlblogger,\" (a young woman who is chronically online) or a model.   \n\n'''Memes''' are an incredibly common way to link these aesthetic visuals together and create a community. One format that is incredibly popular is the '''\"I would go to school if...\"''' meme where \"if this were the teacher\" is captioned under an image of a model, \"if this was the uniform\" under the fashion with the aesthetic, \"if this was the lunch\" under diet coke and cigarettes, etc. Another common meme is the '''\"Are ya winning, daughter?\" format''' edited with pngs of the visuals, garments, albums, and books associated with the community surrounding a simple drawing of a crying girl and her father checking in on her. The '''\"You are the average of the five people you spend the most time with. The five people in question:\"''' template overlays the quote above and different outlines of five people with pngs of the above visuals. Another is a '''comment/tag game''' where an image with different waif-related categories of media and visuals (books, albums, beverages, types of skirts, etc.) are in rows with numbers, letters, and symbols above each item. A user then puts the symbols of what they would pick from each category in the comments.     \n\n'''Outfit moodboards''' and object collections link the different components of the aesthetic together. The outfit is often accompanied by transparents of coffee, newspaper headlines, cigarettes and other drugs, and books.\n\nThere are also '''multiple variations''' on the aesthetic, with users leaving out certain elements or adding images with [[Preppy]], [[Nymphet]], [[Vintage Parisian]], and [[Shabby Chic]] aesthetics. The constant between all Waif bloggers is their admiration for models and the shared language and memes.\n\nFor the purposes of citation and examples, see the [http://web.archive.org/web/20211113153341/https://www.tumblr.com/tagged/waif?sort=top Wayback Machine archive of the tumblr tag.] \n\n==Fashion==\nThis section is under construction\n\n=== Tops ===\n\n* Tank tops that have a grunge-y print\n*Baggy sweaters\n\n===Bottoms===\n\n*Extremely short pleated skirts, an article of clothing often associated with [[Y2K]] and Heroin Chic\n*Plaid and check mini skirts, often from Burberry and with the distinctive belt piece detail\n*Chiffon wrap skirts used in ballet practice clothing\n\n=== Shoes ===\n\n* UGG boots\n\n=== Outerwear ===\n\n* Fur coats.

This can also be brought on by '''listening to \"subliminals,\"''' which are videos of montages set to music that would supposedly implant subliminal messages into the brain and bring about whatever the video's purpose is. Some common subliminal video topics include becoming skinnier, richer, and having an enhanced confidence. \n<br />\n==Criticism==\nThis section is under construction\n\n<br />\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:Lana 444.jpg\nFile:Pointe 444.jpg\nFile:Bed 444.jpg\nFile:Marina 444.jpg\nFile:Cigs 444.jpg\nFile:Tweet 444.jpg\nFile:Meme 444.png|meme by soviet-girl\nFile:Girl 444.jpg\nFile:Schoolgirls 444.png\nFile:J E N N I F E R.jpg\nFile:QeQe blK 400x400.jpg\nFile:9536e598c74f8eed9168721205a3346b.jpg\nFile:Tumblr 23f85207fa93b29191e6aa3afb6fc25a 1df8aa16 540.jpg\nFile:Tumblr pe5mjpd7Fj1xoathlo1 250.jpg\nFile:Liz viciousss.jpg\nFile:Waifspo.jpg\nFile:Whisper.jpg\nFile:White sheets.jpg\nFile:Lily rosee.jpg\nFile:Waif 1.jpg\nFile:Waif 2.jpg\nFile:Waif 5.jpg\nFile:Waif 3.jpg\nFile:Waif 4.jpg\nFile:Waif 9.jpg\nFile:Waif 8.jpg\nFile:Waif 7.jpg\nFile:Waif 6.jpg\nFile:Waif 13.jpg\nFile:Waif 12.jpg\nFile:Waif 15.jpg\nFile:Waif 14.jpg\nFile:Waif 10.jpg\nFile:Waif 11.jpg\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Feminine]]\n[[Category:Sensitive Content]]"}}}]}}}}
