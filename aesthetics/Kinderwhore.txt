Not that I'm so desirable. I didn't do the kinder-whore thing because I thought I was so hot. When I see the look used to make one more appealing, it pisses me off. When I started, it was a ''What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?'' thing. My angle was irony.'\n\nThe name 'Kinderwhore' was coined by melody maker journalist Everett True in an interview with Kurt Cobain and Courtney Love (1993). The term was mostly used by the media and less by the musicians themselves.  \n\nA often mentioned inspiration for the style are the musicians Kim Shattuck of the band ''The Muffs'', Christine Amphlett of the band ''Divinyls'' or Katie Jane Garside of the band ''Daisy Chainsaw''. \n\nThe kinderwhore-fashion  became a source of inspiration for many designers such as Hedi Slimane, Batsheva Hay and even Marc Jacobs.\u00a0In 2019, Batsheva Hay named Courtney Love's \u201ckinderwhore aesthetic\u201d as a big inspiration.\u00a0 Hay said the look was \"so of it's time, but also so ahead of it's time\".\n\n\n== Fashion ==\nKinderwhore fashion was designed to take the most \"feminine\" aspects of gender roles, inflating them to a cartoonish level, only to subvert it into the rawest, angriest, most badass way possible, where they were not afraid to get as aggressive and confident on stage as their counterparts in the mostly male dominated [[Grunge]] scene.  Some elements of Kinderwhore fashion include:\n\n* peter pan collars\n* babydoll dresses\n* slip dresses\n* mary jane shoes\n* combat boots\n* platform shoes\n* ripped tights\n*messy makeup\n* red lipstick\n* messy hair\n*bleached blonde hair\n* hair barrettes\n*ribbons\n\n*soft, pastel colors and materials paired with dark colors\n*black accessories\n*lace dresses or dresses with lace accents and cute details\n*cardigans\n*faux fur coats\n*leather jackets\n*kneesocks\n*lace socks\n*ripped tights.\n*heels\n*chokers, chains, etc\n\nKinderwhore clothing can most easily be found in charity or thrift shops, or DIY'ed. Kinderwhore is a stlye within grunge so the goal is to not look neat and tidy, damaged clothing is better to use for this specific look.\n\nThe kinderwhore fashion has found a big resurgence in recent years due to social media sites like TikTok, Instagram and Pinterest, with creators like ''Lipst1ckteeth.''\n\nFairy grunge is a similar style where the wearer doesn't seem as interested in subverting gender norms, but instead just appreciates the aesthetic appeal of the contrast that Kinderwhore had set out to accomplish. Fairy grunge is used to make ones self look more appealing in the way that clashes with Kinderwhores philosophies, and therefore cannot be called Kinderwhore.\n\n[https://www.pinterest.com/madeleineidle/kinderwhore/ Kinderwhore by Madeleine] [https://www.pinterest.com/cyberrpixie/kinderwhoreriotgrrl/ kinderwhore/riotgrrrl by hans and manna] [https://www.pinterest.com/m00npr1nc3ss/kinderwhore/ kinderwhore by mushroomcloud] [https://www.pinterest.com/dakotaskye02/kinderwhore/ kinderwhore by dakota]\n\n==Music==\nMusically, Kinderwhore fit right alongside their male counterparts in the Grunge scene, taking the world by storm in the 1990s.
