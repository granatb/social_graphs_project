Ravencore is similar to, but not the same as, [[Crowcore]]. Ravencore is a nature-centered aesthetic, taking inspiration from ravens themselves. In nature, ravens generally prefer undisturbed mountainous or forested areas over urban areas (unlike crows); feed on scavenged carrion, small invertebrates, and insects; gather in groups (though they are usually seen alone or in pairs); and are known to hoard shiny objects. Ravencore is built around these basic principles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMembers of Ravencore often collect rocks, minerals, crystals, moss, candles, bones/skulls, insects, and other natural \"trinkets\". Oftentimes, the aesthetic centers around friendship with wild corvids and a broad respect for nature.\n\nRavens, followers of the ravencore aesthetic, are often very prideful of their collection and enjoy displaying and sharing it with others.\n\nThis style embraces misty, mossy, shaded forests. If you are looking for a grittier, muddier, and brighter aesthetic you may want to consider [[Goblincore]].\n\n<br />\n\n== Hoard Content ==\nRavens often collect\n\n* Bones (sometimes teeth)\n* Skulls\n* Crystals\n* Trinkets (odds and ends)\n* Rustic books\n* Jars\n\n* Houseplants\n*Candles\n\n== Visuals ==\n\n* Ravens\n* Birds\n* Feathers\n* Forests\n* Mountains\n* Mushrooms\n* Moss\n* Plants\n* Overgrown plants\n* Vines on the side of walls\n* Crows\n* Books\n* Candles\n* Stone walls\n* Wild animals\n* Logs\n* Rocks\n* Small trinkets\n* Shiny objects\n* Insects\n* Skulls\n* Crystals\n\n<br />\n\n== What Brings Joy ==\nFollowers of the ravencore aesthetic are often at peace when surrounded by nature. Mossy forests, mountains, ferns and mushrooms, slow-trickling creeks, twinkling of stars at night, and the soft glow of fireflies are all commonly calming themes within the aesthetic.\n\nMembers are also often comforted by old books, mossy stone houses, and spending time with fellow ravens. Gardening and caring for plants or animals is also a common theme within the aesthetic.\n<br />\n\n=== Mindset ===\nThe aesthetic is very inclusive, with groups striving to ensure that everyone is welcome. While the aesthetic is not a movement, it often rejects the normal roles of society and its members can be seen working against injustice and towards equality.\n\n<br />\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery orientation=\"square\" widths=\"130\">\nFile:97978133 10214010115607548 7333359231434752000 o.jpg\nFile:97781917 10214010117967607 6961787269761990656 n.jpg\nFile:97639675 10214010117127586 9185796604932653056 n.jpg\nFile:97390131 10214010114527521 1319492684376702976 n.jpg\nFile:96953689 10214010111527446 347781111323033600 o.jpg\nFile:96941708 10214010112527471 3155343340854050816 n.jpg\nFile:96773512 10214010116007558 4606591762012569600 n.jpg\nFile:96112892 10214010118527621 8547220704154615808 n.jpg\nFile:97991830 10214010110847429 7380220172197429248 n.jpg\nFile:97994867 10214010116847579 1640381862998179840 n.jpg\nFile:98028358 10214010113447494 2761238958544257024 n.jpg\nFile:98114775 10214010111167437 7553430117276450816 o.jpg\nFile:98133354 10214010118207613 3209714409890906112 n.jpg\nFile:98172958 10214010112887480 9126256005884149760 n.jpg\nFile:99275977 10214010114127511 5601303176994095104 o.jpg\nFile:96360107 10214010116487570 3537365348800004096 n.jpg\nFile:Creatures of the forest Venn diagram.png|Creatures of the forest Venn diagram\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Needs work]]\n[[Category:Core Suffix]]\n[[Category:Visual]]\n[[Category:List of Bird-Based Aesthetics]]"}}}]}}}}
