The main focus is dark, mossy forests and sometimes things like fungi and liverworts are prevalent. The main colour scheme is mostly various, usually dark, shades of green, browns and other natural hues, and light/bright colours almost never pop up. Man made objects in this aesthetic include, but are not limited to, shacks, huts and cabins. This aesthetic is closely related to other forest-themed aesthetics like [[Forestpunk]], [[Cottagecore]], and [[Mushroomcore]]. \n\n==Activities==\nMany aesthetics can be achieved via activities. Some examples of mosscore activities would be:\n\n*Collecting moss samples\n*Keeping a journal\n*Gathering wild fruit\n*Reading old nature books\n*Bird watching\n*Building birdhouses\n*Collecting flora/fauna (mostly bugs)\n*Long walks in the woods\n*Picnics on moss-covered rocks\n*Any activity that is related to observing or creating things with nature quietly\n\n==Resources==\nExternal links to help get a better understanding of this aesthetic.\n\n==== Pinterest Boards====\n\n*[https://www.pinterest.com/ivorylemonade/mosscore/ mosscore by maria \ud83c\udf3f]\n*[https://www.pinterest.com/aestheticcoresuffix/mosscore/ Mosscore by Core Suffix]\n*[https://www.pinterest.com/1d_tpwk/mosscore/ | mosscore | by Asi :)]\n*[https://www.pinterest.com/llkizel/mosscore/ mosscore by char]\n*[https://www.pinterest.com/maraboicu/mosscore/ mosscore by mara]\n\n==Fashion==\nMosscore fashion is similar to [[Dark Academia]] and [[Cryptidcore]], but with a comfier twist (eg, plaid pants and a skirt with oxfords and a large dark green sweater and rolled down socks.) The look is associated with forests, studying, and chaos.\n\n==Phrases==\nThe Mosscore community on Tumblr has created the following phrases:\n\n*Let the moss consume me\n*Chaos? More like Cha-MOSS!\n* I am secretly an old forest god\n* Do not perceive me, fear me\n\n== Music==\n\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62RvnXZgHwQ The Moss by Cosmo Sheldrake]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOOk4oCmQuk Green by Cavetown]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yaVtsPIVVM Willow Tree March by thepaperkitesband]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmIwm5RElRs I Don\u2019t Want To Set The World On Fire by The Ink Spots]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsJwQjWS48o Dear Fellow Traveler by Sea Wolf]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_Xcripw7hw Run rings right wrongs by Cosmo Sheldrake]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jdsC7lbEMY The fly by by Cosmo Sheldrake]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDZaiM8oAOU \"Smother\" by Daughter]\n\n==Playlists==\n====Spotify====\n\n* [https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0zpFyJkiXGtMjCsXQDL2DT mosscore by divinosaur]\n\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6os15ScaqMOf0v8nyUtHaq Mosscore! \ud83c\udf31 by Ian]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/59L2HUNO2gK0evX3ydLelL i like birds by elvira]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6lqohKpb91pIGxjUxLGrnK Hiraeth vibes by Peeledgums]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2ZLdAE3A1GQe2tWYLTu9L2 forest soul by jeunoisette]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2Ugke8rjmgwz2iBJbZLSDk Mosscore - instrumental by Cassian]\n\n====YouTube====\n\n*[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLz9ja5CBY2rJR1orDZMc6KUURWK_CClNd Mosscore by Repeat Arts]\n\n==Literature==\n\n*Warrior Cats (particularly ''the prophecies begin'')\n*Watership Down\n\n==Gallery ==\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"150\">\nMosscore-Pines and Moss.jpeg|link=https://millivedder.tumblr.com/post/642060182883598336/hidden-in-the-cedar\nPerson Holding a Fern.jpg\nMushroom Cottagecore.jpg\nMore-dullcore.jpg\nGloomy Raindrops on Moss.webp|link=https://unsplash.com/photos/htvWuBLTk1s\nRock-moss-forest-green.jpg\nWoodlandgoth8.jpg\nTumblr 502604957d850b33f9e5645e5d5488a1 c3f69011 640.jpg\nThis is cute.jpg\n81282172-C788-4D3E-9C42-49D3228BEDFC.jpeg\nMossy forest.webp\nLandscape-nature-waterfall-forest-ferns-moss-green-trees-hill-oregon-wallpaper-preview.jpg\nFile:Mossling bb.jpg\nFile:Mossling.jpg\nFile:Moss sprouts.jpg\nFile:Moss sproutling.jpg\nFile:Orange moss.jpg\nFile:Green moss.jpg\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Core Suffix]]\n[[Category:Visual]]\n[[Category:Needs work]]\n[[Category:Fields and forests]]"}}}]}}}}
