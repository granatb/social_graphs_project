Youtube being banned in China makes their ability to be able to post and promote their content on the platform questionable, as they'd need some sort of permission from the  government. Even though the state's propaganda isn't dominating the videos it's presence is still noticeable.<blockquote>''\"In 2019, the state-backed People\u2019s Daily newspaper gave Li its People\u2019s Choice award for her video featuring calligraphy and the Malaysian royals. In August, she was nominated as a member of the CCP-backed All-China Youth Federation, which counts previous presidents and premiers among its alumni.....<br><br>In recent years, China\u2019s international reputation has taken a battering over Beijing\u2019s repressive policies in Xinjiang, Hong Kong and Tibet. State media outlets have used colorful short films showing happy Uyghurs and Tibetans in traditional dress to paint those places in a positive light. State representations of Xinjiang and Tibet often appear to mimic the look and feel of Li and Dianxi\u2019s videos, complete with smiling people cooking traditional food and working the land.<br><br>Dianxi has recently expanded the scope of her work to include travel dispatches. In July, she went to a Tibetan autonomous prefecture in Yunnan and filmed life in a small mountain community, its people, architecture, and food. The footage is filled with heartwarming scenes of Dianxi living among the villagers, learning how to make traditional pots and drinking yak butter tea. Any thoughts of China\u2019s decades of repressive policies towards Tibetans are gently spirited away.\"\n- ''Isobel Cockrell for .coda, April 2021''<ref>https://www.codastory.com/soft-power-2/chinas-cottagecore-influencers-fairytale-life-in-china/</ref></blockquote>\n\n== Resources ==\nTBA\n\n=== Vendors ===\nTBA\n\n=== YouTube Channels ===\n\n* [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQG_fzADCunBTV1KwjkfAQQ Dianxi Xiaoge]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYpkch1t09p2HCp9ApcMxrg Ermi Chuiyan]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClaEdLrmti779-tyovta8zw Grandpa Amu]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoC47do520os_4DBMEFGg4A Liziqi]\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery widths=\"130\" orientation=\"landscape\" spacing=\"small\">\nFile:Chinese Fan.jpg\nFile:Chinese Village.jpg\nFile:Dumpling.jpg\nFile:Liziqi.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n== References ==\n<references /><br />\n\n[[Category:Needs work]]\n[[Category:Chinese]]\n[[Category:Core Suffix]]"}}}]}}}}
