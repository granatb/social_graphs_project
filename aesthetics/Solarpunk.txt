Solarpunk also emphasizes handcrafted wares (as opposed to mass-produced products) and community. The 'punk' in Solarpunk comes from the genre's anti-authoritarian and anti-capitalist nature, as well as its strong focus on community and prefigurative politics, which separates it from aesthetics like [[Cyberprep]]. \n\nSolarpunk futurism is not nihilistic like [[cyberpunk]] and it avoids [[steampunk]]'s potentially quasi-reactionary tendencies: it is about ingenuity, generativity, independence, and community. At its core, Solarpunk is a vision of a future that embodies the best of what humanity can achieve: a post-scarcity, post-hierarchy, post-capitalistic world where humanity sees itself as part of nature and clean energy replaces fossil fuels.\n\nThe Solarpunk Manifesto may be found [https://www.re-des.org/a-solarpunk-manifesto/ here].

They include a mash-up of the following:\n\n* 1800s age-of-sail/frontier living (but with more bicycles)\n* Creative reuse of existing infrastructure (sometimes post-apocalyptic, sometimes present-weird)\n* [[Art Nouveau]]\n* Hayao Miyazaki\n* [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jugaad Jugaad]-style innovation from the non-Western world\n* High-tech backends with simple, elegant outputs\n\n==Media==\n=== Books ===\nWhile Solarpunk is a relatively young literary sub-genre, there are stories that take place in a solarpunk world or contain solarpunk elements, as well as older novels that helped inspire the genre. There are also numerous non-fiction works that relate to Solarpunk culture and applications in real life. \n\n''Alphabetical by Author.
