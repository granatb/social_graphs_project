Many would argue that buying into this aesthetic and subculture is not far from romanticization of pedophilia. Please research the implications of this style thoroughly before making the decision to involve yourself in it. If this makes you uncomfortable, but you do like the look, you can still be a part of the Nymphet community and frown upon people in the community who do romanticize pedophilia.

Nymphet is an illusion created in the mind of Humbert Humbert, the (unreliable) main character and narrator of both the films and book. For the term, it is used by Humbert as a way to justify his predatory actions towards Dolores Haze, his victim. ''As an aesthetic, this word refers to the style of Dolores Haze in the movies, that influences the fashion nowadays. It mostly revolves around youth, summer dresses, and carefree fun.''\n\n<br />\n\n==History==\n''This section is under construction''\n\n''Lolita'' by Vladimir Nabokov was published in 1955 to much controversy; some publications demeaned it and the novel was banned in multiple countries. The book's status as a classic required different publishers to find new ways of conveying the premise of the novel. Shari L. Savage's ''Lolita: Genealogy of a Cover Girl,'' an examination of book cover design, lists the common visuals that the designers use, the vast majority of which overlap with visuals that nymphet aesthetic bloggers reblog today. \n\nIn 1962, Stanley Kubrick adapted the book for film. On the film poster are the two most iconic symbols of the character to this day: heart-shaped sunglasses and a red lollipop. \n\nThe 1997 adaptation by Adrian Lyne provided inspiration for most, if not all, fashion points. Milkmaid braids, sailor collars, retro swimsuits, and the color palette are all clear connections between the modern nymphet community's fashion style and the film. \n\nThe work that arguably introduced young women to the archetype and aesthetic of Nymphet was Lana del Rey's album ''Born to Die'' (2012). She references Nabokov's prose, having sex with older men, visuals from the films, being sexually attractive at a young age, and having a party lifestyle<ref>The songs on Lana del Rey's album ''Born to Die'' reference \"heart-shaped sunglasses\" (\"Diet Mountain Dew\"), \"light of my life, fire of my loins\" (\"Off to the Races\"), \"table dancing at the local dive\" (\"This Is What Makes Us Girls\"). More lyrical analysis can be found here. https://genius.com/albums/Lana-del-rey/Born-to-die</ref>. \n\nIn the same year, Marina and the Diamonds released ''Electra Heart'', which explores feminine archetypes, sexuality, teenage girlhood, and the carefree yet vulnerable personality type that those with nymphet aesthetics can relate to.<ref>Bubblegum Bitch, Primadonna Girl, Homewrecker, and Teen Idle most prominently display this.https://genius.com/albums/Marina/Electra-heart</ref> These two albums being released at around the same time made the two artists' listeners aware of, and yearn for, this sort of persona. \n\nTumblr was the de facto website for this subculture to gather. \n\nThe culture diminished heavily during the Tumblr Purge in December 2018, which specifically happened because of the presence of child pornography on the site<ref>https://www.forbes.com/sites/masonsands/2018/12/20/tumblocalypse-where-tumblr-and-its-users-are-headed-after-the-ban/?sh=3295fe170207</ref>. Because some Nymphet bloggers had NSFW gifs and discussion, most users in the aesthetic had their blogs taken away by the administrators. In addition, tags for lolita and nymphet showed no results, causing the community to go by many other names, such as coquette, doelette, nympet, loleeta, etc. <br />\n==Visuals==\n''This page is under construction''  \n\nNymphet visuals focus heavily on adolescence and the gateway between childhood and adulthood.  \n\nThe most prominent visuals are the ones associated with the film and cover art of the books: the '''heart-shaped sunglasses and red lollipop'''.      \n\n'''1950s teenaged girl culture''' is a large influence on the community. The trends and iconography of that time include saddle shoes, shiny red vintage cars, and diner milkshakes, which are some of the most common photo subjects in the aesthetic. This is because the novel itself takes place in the 1950s, with the film adaptations retaining the aesthetic of the time period.       \n\nCherries, specifically '''maraschino cherries''', are one of the most iconic images associated with the nymphet aesthetic due to their connotations with innocent femininity, nostalgia, and sexuality. Its symbolic meaning can be traced back to 17th century literature, and its use in American pop music, slang, and party tricks (tying a knot in the mouth) cemented it as representative of adolescent sexuality.<ref>https://www.vice.com/en/article/bmwwam/history-why-cherries-are-so-sexual</ref>\n\nImagery associated with the mouth in general is very popular. In the novel, Humbert Humbert often fixates on Dolores's mouth in a sexual connotation. The cover for the Knopf edition of ''Lolita'' also features a close-up of the corner of a girl's mouth. '''Lips''', blowing bubblegum, lip cosmetics, and images of biting down on food or flowers is thus one of the most featured things in moodboards and blogs. <br />\n==Media==\n===Movies===\n\n*''Lolita'' (1962), (1997)\n*''Leon the Professional'' (1994)\n*''American Beauty'' (1999)\n*''The Crush'' (1993)\n*''Pretty Baby'' (1978)\n*''Breezy'' (1973)\n*''Hick'' (2011)\n*''Copenhagen'' (2014)\n*''The Diary of a Teenage Girl'' (2015)\n*''Jeune et Jolie'' (2013)\n*''The Lover'' (1992)\n\n<br />\n==Music==\n\n*\"Lolita\", \"Put me in a movie\", \"Off to the Races\" - Lana del Rey\n*\"My Heart Belongs to Daddy\" - Marilyn Monroe\n* \"Guys My Age\" - Hey Violet\n*\"You're Sixteen\" - Ringo Starr\n*\"Lolita\" - Knee High Fox\n*\"Moi...

The main inspirations for the aesthetic are Tadzio from the 1971 adaptation of Death in Venice, Leonardo DiCaprio and vintage boys clothes, especially sailor clothes and woodland themes and colours.\n\nThe Faunlet aesthetic does seem to have more of a following in the LGBTQ community than in heterosexual circles. Straight members of the Faunlet community do exist, though it's nowhere near as common.  \n\n===Japanese Nymphet===\n''This section is under construction''\n\nJapanese Nymphet differs from the rest of the article because rather than it being a community and quasi-identity, the Nymphet aesthetic there is exclusively based on fashion that is based on the costume design of the two ''Lolita'' movies.  \n\n==Criticism==\n''This section is under construction''\n\n<br />\n\n==Gallery (American Version)==\n<gallery widths=\"130\">\n138441577fc2238cb4fffb44f7991f4d.jpg\n16e4b3c1311001ef72de4ce41f8017fc.jpg\n1d24f0f4135cc3fd65b055530105522d.jpg\n22f05baae1e71a031a5f6866bc533f00.jpg\n422ef6761090c84b9cf5d562bb9f82e1.jpg\n55e1148d3ff607d2a5990e1bc1603d6e.jpg\n5b51c4569ef3a55a0717956eb1f98f17.jpg\n85afdcbcf2cf27b62c0af67e71a3a150.jpg\nA082a14df8a31d01998c73b25fb1a13a.jpg\nA77bc71ddaaecd45b7dc93e6f0185b6f.jpg\nB6f98b72a60e0035181765c390f3299f.jpg\nBa5258b49df6a3db0bbe37c869ed959a.jpg\nC53532b85c932403c06cefee54a18023.jpg\nCa62ce2b94f006acccf825ff3e0d728b.jpg\nE82ac2dea2855b2c4e0d8abab9022e94.jpg\nE936fc4103e09e0cc54a01d8154f434c.jpg\nF59bff88010d01d4535b125452a11d58.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n{{Infobox album}}\n\n==Gallery (Japanese)==\n<br /><gallery>\nFile:Nymphet fashion.jpg\nFile:Er7fA6LVgAE7hDK.jpg\nFile:Er7fFP5VkAMdYac.jpg\nFile:Ek2oK6FVcAItGrK.jpg\nC w Zu1UwAQu5 2.jpg\n4d6189320e5ed1406ef76e68d28d3a880ecca059.jpg\nFile:Larme lolita girl.jpg\nFile:Larme french lolita.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n<references /><br />\n\n[[Category:Fashion]]\n[[Category:Visual]]\n[[Category:Sensitive Content]]\n[[Category:Feminine]]\n[[Category:Sexy]]"}}}]}}}}
