Literary historian\u00a0J. A. Cuddon\u00a0defined the horror story as \"a piece of fiction in prose of variable length which shocks, or even frightens the reader, or perhaps induces a feeling of repulsion or loathing\".\u00a0It creates an eerie and frightening atmosphere. Horror is frequently supernatural, though it might be non-supernatural. Often the central menace of a work of horror fiction can be interpreted as a\u00a0metaphor\u00a0for the larger\u00a0fears\u00a0of a society.\n\n==Visual==\nHorror aesthetic visuals are designed to achieve some sort of element of discomfort, fear, disgust, or any sort of imagery that can trigger the \"fight or flight\" response people naturally have. This differs from the [[Halloween]] visual aesthetic because Halloween imagery tends to be sillier with its handling of macabre imagery, thus not being taken as seriously as it could when it's played straight in the Horror aesthetic. \n\n== Fashion ==\n\n* Graphic T-shirts\n* Hoodies / Jackets\n* Thigh-High Socks\n* Fishnet Stockings\n* Boots, Sneakers, Or any shoe you see fit\n* Bodycon Dresses & Skirts\n* Knee-High socks\n* Mask\n* Fake Blood\n* Heavy Makeup\n* Distressed Shorts & Jeans\n* Pleated Skirts\n* Any Dark Clothing\n* Striped Shirts (long sleeve or short sleeve)\n* Oversized Sweaters\n* Chokers (optional)\n*Chains, Buckles, and Harnesses\n\n==Media==\n\n=== Written ===\nHorror has had a rich tradition of existence dating back to the beginning of the written word, but writers such as Edgar Allen Poe, Bram Stoker, Mary Shelley, and H.P. Lovecraft have used this fear to craft rich literary works that chilled us to the core even before the invention of film. They expertly strung together words to paint dark, macabre imagery for the reader to envision in their heads, whether it was a small, personal scale descent into psychosis or having the entire vast, uncaring nature of the universe exposed to you all at once and driving you absolutely mad in the process.\n\n===Films===\nHorror films are films that seek to elicit\u00a0fear\u00a0for entertainment purposes. Initially inspired by literature from authors like\u00a0Edgar Allan Poe,\u00a0Bram Stoker, and\u00a0Mary Shelley,\u00a0horror has existed as a film genre for more than a century. The macabre and the supernatural are frequent themes. Horror may also overlap with the\u00a0fantasy,\u00a0supernatural fiction, and\u00a0thriller\u00a0genres.\n\nHorror films often aim to evoke viewers'\u00a0nightmares,\u00a0fears,\u00a0revulsion, and\u00a0terror\u00a0of the unknown. Plots within the horror genre often involve the intrusion of an\u00a0evil\u00a0force, event, or personage into the everyday world. Prevalent elements include\u00a0ghosts,\u00a0extraterrestrials,\u00a0vampires,\u00a0werewolves,\u00a0demons,\u00a0Satanism,\u00a0evil clowns,\u00a0gore,\u00a0torture,\u00a0vicious animals,\u00a0evil witches,\u00a0monsters,\u00a0giant monsters,\u00a0zombies,\u00a0cannibalism,\u00a0psychopaths,\u00a0natural,\u00a0ecological, or\u00a0man-made disasters, and\u00a0serial killers.\n\n=== Video Games ===\n\n* Dead by daylight\n* Silent Hill\n* Amnesia\n* Outlast\n* Resident evil 1-5\n* Until dawn\n* The evil within\n* Observer\n* Slenderman: The eight pages\n* Friday the 13th\n* Visage\n* Darkwood\n\n===Music===\n'''Horrorcore'''\u00a0is a subgenre of\u00a0[[Hip-Hop]] music\u00a0based on\u00a0horror-themed and often darkly\u00a0transgressive\u00a0lyrical content and imagery. Its origins derived from certain\u00a0hardcore hip-hop\u00a0and\u00a0gangster rap\u00a0artists, such as \nthe\u00a0Ghetto Boys, which began to incorporate\u00a0supernatural,\u00a0occult, or\u00a0psychological horror\u00a0themes into their lyrics.\n\nOutside of that, a lot of horror music is mostly tense and orchestral by design, with some examples of it bleeding into the world of Rock and [[Metal]]. A lot of horror metal music will delve more into the realm of True Crime or the horrors of war, though some horror-based metal will draw upon classic works of horror literature.\n\n==Subgenres ==\n\n===Psychological Horror===\n''Under Construction''\n\n===Slasher===\nThe '''Slasher''' is dedicated to all of the Slasher movie idols that have been appearing in film since the 1970s exploitation cinema era. While some Slashers predate the era (namely Leatherface from The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Michael Myers from the Halloween films), most of the Slasher icons came about from the 1980s, no doubt inspired by the Reagan era of politics. Characters such as Freddy Krueger, Jason Voorhees, and the Chucky Doll came about from this period, but examples of modern Slasher icons include Ghostface (from the Scream series) and John \"Jigsaw\" Kramer (from Saw).\n\n===Universal Monster===\nThe '''Universal Monster''' is dedicated to the horror films released from 1925 (back in the Silent Film era) all the way into the 1950s that frightened audiences of the time but nowadays is largely seen as kitschy and silly (which this shift began in the late 1940s). It is named the \"Universal Monster\" aesthetic because Universal Studios were the ones who released these classic movies, though there was an attempt to modernize the concept for the modern era with the \"Dark Universe\" (starting with 2014's Dracula Untold) which was an attempt to use the Universal Movie Monsters to create something similar to the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\n\n=== Lovecraftian/Cosmic Horror===\n'''Lovecraftian''' is a subgenre of horror fiction that emphasizes the cosmic horror of the unknown more than gore or shock. It is named after American author H. P. Lovecraft. Cosmic horror is defined as a horror story designed to highlight just how small and insignificant we humans are in the grand scheme of the universe. The most popular figure in Lovecraftian horror is Cthulhu. For more information of Lovecraftian horror, please check out [https://lovecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Main_Page The H.P. Lovecraft Wiki].\n\n===\"Satanic Panic\"===\n''Under Construction''\n\n===True Crime===\n'''True Crime''' Horror has a strong focus on real-world crimes committed, with a strong focus on murder (especially serial killers). This particular aspect of the Horror aesthetic can be particularly controversial because it leads to some individuals glorifying actual murderers like Ted Bundy, Eric Harris & Dylan Klebold (the perpetrators of the infamous Columbine shootings), and [[Incel|Elliot Rodgers]].\n\n===Mascot Horror===\n'''Mascot Horror''' is focused around the idea of taking children's mascots and subverting the initial purpose of them by turning them into killers. The concept has been around for many years, but the most popular example of this in action is the Five Nights at Freddy's franchise.\n\n=== Creepypasta ===\nCreepypastas are a type of copypasta, a large block of text that gets copy and pasted around the web. Copypastas usually focus on being funny, but creepypastas focus on being creepy, hence the name. A lot of them are written to be a believable folk tale, ranging from slasher like murders and creatures to even lost and/or haunted video games and TV shows.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"130\">\n9k=Lovecraft.jpeg|Lovecraftian/Cosmic Horror\n3aec09e360a9a084a9178d37f6bcb438.jpg\nAvatars-000318226141-5xge51-t500x500.jpg\nSample e9ffcd1c07708eae6585407d037edad7.jpg\nMascot Horror DBD Robbie.jpg\nRobbie the Rabbit.png\nFNAF.jpeg\nBanana Splits Movie.jpg\nDuck Season.jpg\nDBD Mister Puddles.png\nMurder House game.jpg\nAb5cfe02697b61a196f4afc7dceb6640.jpg\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Visual]]\n[[Category:Written]]\n[[Category:Needs work]]\n[[Category:Music]]\n[[Category:Creepy]]"}}}]}}}}
