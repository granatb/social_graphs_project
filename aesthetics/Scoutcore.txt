Activities such as campfire songs, games, bonding activities (e.g, braiding hair, hiking), bead crafts,earning patches and the euphoria of summer make up this aesthetic. Scoutcore isn't mainly focused on girl or boy scouts, mostly having fun, camp morals, bunkmates, collecting badges and summer activites. Sometimes, even a level of clich\u00e9 camp romance. Scoutism was created in 1907 by Robert Baden Powell on the Brownsea Island in United Kingdom.\n\n\n== Activities (Physical)==\nCamp activities are vital to having fun. Can you recall a time when you've been to camp and haven't done at least one fun outdoor activity? Such as...\n\n*Tug-o-war\n*Hand games\n*Canoeing\n*Hiking\n*Sack racing\n*Climbing trees\n*Tag\n* Swimming\n*Fishing\n*Egg Race\n\n\u2026and many more!\n\n== Activities (Indoor) ==\nAll the activities aren't necessarily outdoorsy. There are many indoor activities that can be just as entertaining, most similar to what you would do at a slumber party. For example...\n\n*Truth or Dare\n*Playing Marbles\n*Styling hair\n*Bead crafts (bracelets, necklaces)\n* Sewing (or embroidery)\n*Macram\u00e9 (tying knots)\n*Deep conversions on romance\n*Pillow fights\n*Reading (especially books on flora/fauna)\n*Telling scary stories\n\n...this is only a few!\n\n==Fashion==\nThere are two types of distinguishable Scoutcore fashion. One group wears more traditional scout clothing (khaki uniforms, scarves, oxfords, many patches and pins, striped crew socks). Each country has its own uniform. \n\n'''First Group:'''\n<gallery bordersize=\"none\" bordercolor=\"#985632\">\nsnip.PNG\nb.PNG\nbabt.PNG\n</gallery>The second group focuses on more modern camp looks from the 70's. The same morals and aesthetic stay the same. Only the clothing changes and is more focused on stripes (and stripes on socks), ringer shirts, soft or denim shorts, white shoes or Converse.\n\n'''Second Group:'''\n<gallery>\nD.PNG\n70.PNG\ngroup 2.PNG\n</gallery>\n\n==Gallery ==\n''Under Construction''\n\n==Songs==\n\n*[https://open.spotify.com/track/6RpOwx05L1XK3Zix8heU4Z?si=sk8YBdaYTGOeAWQY2VH2Dw Sometimes - song by Kero Kero Bonito]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/track/3fpKJgC5xCpdOYZVpIJThH?si=teln4SekRNWFdTdCEyQKlg Swimming - song by Kero Kero Bonito]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/track/7q6rvUXrCKqYSzSHRp3HI2?si=ui3GkzSOTKWwhO-H1QGbcw Campers - song by Henson Popa]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/track/0McGlEwtVz9L1qiMO86pDy?si=OsNRgBz0Rw2BRf2if80eXg Mommomgoaway - song by Henson Popa]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/track/35IjfC7NKsuKiLZ8ggLOqM?si=k0wMabmNSNGVnp5aTFo3fQ Almost Crush - song by Henson Popa]\n\n[[Category:Core Suffix]]\n[[Category:Needs work]]\n[[Category:Visual]]\n[[Category:Fashion]]\n[[Category:Music]]"}}}]}}}}
