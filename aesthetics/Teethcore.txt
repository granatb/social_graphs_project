This aesthetic also includes the thought of being scared of the dentist.\n\nOne of the common parts of teethcore is the fantasy figure known as the Tooth Fairy. It is believed if one places their baby teeth under a pillow, the Tooth Fairy will take it, and leave money in place of the tooth. Because of the creature's 'suspicious activity', it has lead to strange theories. But, because many believe the creature is not real, these theories can not be proven true or false.\n\n==Visual==\n\n*Pinks, whites, off white, gold\n*Pouches of teeth\n*Small cases with teeth inside\n*Blood\n*Braces\n\n==Music==\nHyperdontia - by Creep-p & GHOST\n\nNovocaine - by Creep-p & GHOST\n\n===Spotify Playlists===\n\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6CjBPTTOYkuMgllrGp2RvQ Teethcore Playlist by hotjellydoughnut111-gb]\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery orientation=\"square\" widths=\"130\" spacing=\"small\">\nTeethcore.jpg\nTeethcore image 4.jpg\nTeeth-implant-heart-pink.jpg\nTeethcore image 3.jpg\nTeethcore image 2.jpg\n311815342050211.png\n299477872199211.png\n268149594001211.png\n322676046117211.png\nF6941b1f23a36e04c2e382eafaf93f31.jpg\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Core Suffix]]\n[[Category:Visual]]\n[[Category:Needs work]]\n[[Category:Sensitive Content]]"}}}]}}}}
