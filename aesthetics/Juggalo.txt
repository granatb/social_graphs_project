Juggalos have developed their own idioms, slang, and characteristics. The\u00a0Gathering of the Juggalos, alternatively known as just \"The Gathering\", is a notable annual\u00a0festival\u00a0held by Juggalos and the artists that they support, which have included rap stars such as\u00a0Busta Rhymes,\u00a0Ice Cube, and\u00a0MC Hammer; over its first eleven events, the festival had an average attendance of about 10,000 fans, with a peak of 20,000 in 2010. See also: [[Clowncore]].\n\nWhile many will frown upon the behaviors of many Juggalos out there (and in many instances, rightfully so), it is generally accepted that Shaggy 2 Dope and Violent J (the creators of the Juggalo aesthetic) are genuinely some of the nicest guys you'll ever meet, with Violent J even famously having a fursuit created for him just so he could go to [[furry]] conventions with his daughter because it's something she's passionate about.\n\n\n\n== Visual ==\n* Drinking and spraying the inexpensive\u00a0soft drink\u00a0Faygo.\n* Making and responding to \"whoop, whoop\" calls.\n* Expressing a (generally)\u00a0tongue-in-cheek\u00a0obsession with\u00a0murder, committed with a\u00a0blade\u00a0weapon.\n\n== Fashion ==\n* Wearing\u00a0face paint, generally those either like an\u00a0evil clown\u00a0or perhaps similar to\u00a0corpse paint.\n* Wearing\u00a0HatchetGear.\n* Having the Hatchet man logo applied on personal effects and, die cast, worn as jewelry.\n* Doing hair in the\u00a0spider legs\u00a0style, i.e. like the\u00a0Twiztid\u00a0members\n* Displaying the gesture of\u00a0wicked clown, the\u00a0westside\u00a0sign with the left hand and the\u00a0C\u00a0sign in\u00a0ASL\u00a0with the right, with arms crossed over.\n\n== Music ==\nAlmost exclusively, Juggalos will listen to [[Horror|Horrorcore]] Hip-Hop, and more often than not, it's any sort of act that's sign to Psychopathic Records, the record label owned by the Insane Clown Posse themselves.  Sometimes, they might dip over into the [[Nu-Metal]], [[Metalhead|Metal]], and [[Hip-Hop]] spheres of music, but more often than not, it's almost exclusively Horrorcore Hip-Hop\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery widths=\"185\">\nJuggalo.jpeg|The founders of the Juggalo movement.\nS-l300.jpg|The \"hatchet man\" and \"hatchet women\"\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Music]]\n[[Category:Fashion]]\n[[Category:Visual]]"}}}]}}}}
