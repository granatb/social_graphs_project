For the contemporary music genre and subculture, see [[Goth]].''\n\n\n\n''This page is under construction''\n\nGothic is an aesthetic based around gothic architecture, art and literature. Gothic originally started as a type of architecture starting in the 12th century Europe, with significant characteristics being pointy arches and usually applied on [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_buttress flying buttresses]. Gothic art would eventually evolve into more than a type of outer design, with the label being applied to artwork, poems, books, fashion and eventually shows and video games.  \n\n== Influences ==\n\n=== Misconceptions from Real Gothic Architecture ===\nIn the beginning of the start of Gothic literature, the old cathedrals and buildings were starting to become ruins and filled with mystery, horror, and darkness. However, to the medieval churchgoers, the buildings looked quite different to what most people imagine is a Gothic building now. Because of accumulated smoke, Gothic buildings at the time of the literary movement were dark, gloomy, and evidence of the paranoia and superstition of Medieval peoples. True Gothic buildings were bright, filled with light, and had rainbow-colored stained-glass as a celebration of beauty and light.<ref>https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/architecture/chartres-cathedral-clean-row-experts-divided-over-whether-dirt-should-be-left-place-keep-authentic-gothic-feel-a6706627.html</ref>\n\n=== Edmund Burke's Aesthetic Theories ===\n''This page is under construction''\n\n<br />\n\n== History ==\nThe first Gothic novel is credited to ''The Castle of Otratno'' by Horace Walpole, published in 1764. It inspired many of the Gothic tropes that persisted throughout the genre: ancient prophecies, a castle that seems alive, and concern over sexuality and familial bloodlines. His fascination with Medieval art and ways of thinking is what inspired the novel, and this association with the era will continue throughout the genre.<ref>https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-30313775</ref>\n\nLater, multiple authors published other novels during the same time period: Clara Reeve, Ann Radcliffe, William Beckford, and other authors wrote novels that affirmed Gothic tropes of horror and the supernatural.\n\n== Influence on Other Aesthetics ==\n\n=== Goth Subculture ===\nGoth is a subgenre of rock music. Goth music is about \"swirly\" sounding guitars, a notable bassline and sparse percussion. It could be said that goth music borrows from gothic media. In fact, Bela Lugosi's Dead was inspired by the original actor of the same name, Bela Lugosi. Bauhaus have shown their love for other types of gothic media, such as merchandise that features The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari.\n== Visual ==\n\n* Antique furniture\n*Black cats\n* Blood\n* Bones and skeletons\n* Candelabras and chandeliers\n*Coffins\n*Dead and decaying landscapes\n*European Moorlands\n* Ghosts dressed in white\n* Grimy true Gothic cathedrals\n*Insanity\n*Memento mori/Vanitas motifs\n* Old-fashioned tombstones that are crumbling/weathered\n* Ravens, omens of death\n*Red velvet\n* Storms and rain\n* Vampires\n* Victorian mansions<br />\n\n== Media ==\nFor more see The [https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GothicHorror TVTropes page].\n\n=== Artists ===\n\n* Abigail Larson\n*Aubrey Beardsley\n* Edward Gorey\n* Gustave Dore\n*Harry Clarke\n*Kay Nielson\n*Vincent Price (actor)\n\n=== Comics ===\n\n* ''The Addams Family'' (1938)\n* Some aspects of ''Batman''\n\n* \n\n=== Literature ===\n\n* ''Dracula'' by Bram Stoker\n** For more vampire fiction, see [[Vampire]]\n*''Frankenstein'' by Mary Shelley\n*''Jamaica Inn'' by Daphne du Maurier\n*''Jane Eyre'' by Charlotte Bronte\n*''My Cousin Rachel'' by Daphne du Maurier\n*''Northanger Abbey'' by Jane Austen.
