They wear clothes similar to the Gothic theme, but involve capes and blood.\n\n==History==\nVampires originated in the mythology and folklore of Eastern Europe and the Balkans region but they were not the same as what we think of as the vampire today. The most famous vampire story is Dracula by Bram Stoker, where many of the tropes and symbols - such as bats, capes, and fangs - associated with vampires today originated. \n\nThe idea of vampire hunters, also called slayers, is intertwined with the vampire myth. Garlic, holy water, crucifixes, and wooden stakes are all said to be tools capable of injuring or killing a vampire. Vampires are also commonly said to be not visible in mirrors. \n\nIn older vampire stories, most vampires were male and seduced much younger human women into becoming vampires. In more modern vampire fiction, vampires can be of any gender, with female vampires just as capable of seducing men. Child vampires are extremely rare, and when they do exist they are usually the child of an adult vampire and not a human child who was turned. \n\n==Visuals==\nVampire visuals will often play upon the predator/prey dynamic often associated with Vampire stories, with the \"predator\" often being the one engaging in the Vampire aesthetic while the \"prey\" will typically carry more of an innocent and naive air to them. \n\n* bats \n* blood \n* lips with overhanging fangs \n* oil paintings \n* candles \n* castles \n* white nightgowns \n* glasses with red liquid - blood or wine \n==Fashion==\nVampire fashion is influenced by the styles of 17th and 18th century as well as the Victorian era. Vampires tend to dress in clothes from the era when they were turned, and look elegant but somewhat out of time. It can include any combination of the following:\n\n* Dark red, black, grey clothing\n*Heels, platform boots, heeled boots\n*Boots \n*Gloves\n* Fancy hats\n*Stockings\n*Plain or worn out dresses (Usually off the shoulder, sleeveless or spaghetti strap)\n*Short-shorts\n*Oversized-shirts\n*Mini skirts\n*Tight black pants\n*Fishnet clothing\n*Fangs\n* Clothing from our reminiscent of the late 19th century (or the period your vampire self hails from), especially if in black or originally designed for men\n* Pallid, washed-out makeup\n\n==Media==\n\n===Written===\nVampire literature spans back hundreds of years, from the era of Bram Stoker's ''Dracula'' to the Anne Rice's ''The Vampire Chronicles'' to the ever-controversial ''Twilight'' series by Stephenie Meyer.  Seeing as the Vampire trope was born of the written word, it would naturally tie close to literature, and there would be many interpretations of vampires over the years.  An example of this with lesbian subtext is the 1872 novella Carmilla by Sheridan Le Fanu.\n\n=== Games===\nCreated in 1991, Vampire: The Masquerade is a tabletop role-playing game set in a gothic-punk version of our world, in which vampires are the main protagonists. Focusing on elements of personal horror, the vampires quest to balance their predator and immortal nature with their humanity, the game explores themes of morality, humanity and sanity in a world of supernatural, political and personal dangers.\n\nThe game brought a more modern and deeper twist on the myth of the vampire, creatures of old in a world growing colder and bleaker.\n\nSeveral versions of the game have been published, including Vampire: The Dark Ages, set in the 1200s and Victorian Age: Vampire, set in the late 1800s, as well as video-games, such as Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines or Vampire: The Masquerade - Coteries of New York.\n\n<br />\n\n===Books===\n\n*A Discovery of Witches series by Deborah Harkness\n*''Carmilla'' by Sheridan Le Fanu\n*''Dracula'' by Bram Stoker\n*''Jane Slayre'' by Sherri Browning Erwin\n*The Parasol Protectorate series by Gail Carriger\n*The Vampire Chronicles series by Anne Rice\n*Twilight series by Stephanie Myer\n*Vampire Academy series by Richelle Mead\n*The Black Vampyre: A Legend of St. Domingo by Uriah Derick D'Arcy\n\n===Movies===\n\n* Vampire Academy\n*What We Do in the Shadows\n*The Librarian III: The Curse of the Judas Chalice\n\n===TV Shows===\n\n* A Discovery of Witches\n*Angel\n*Being Human\n*Buffy the Vampire Slayer\n*Dark Shadows\n*True Blood\n*Preacher\n*The Vampire Diaries\n*What We Do in the Shadows\n*Van Helsing\n*Dracula's Daughter\n*Valerie & Her Week of Wonders\n*Vampyros Lesbos\n\n===Webseries===\n\n* Carmilla\n\n===Anime, Manga, & Comics===\n\n* Unholy Blood\n*Vanitas no Carte (The Case Study of Vanitas)\n* Noblesse\n*unTOUCHable\n*Owari No Seraph/Seraph Of The End\n*Chibi Vampire\n*Rosario Vampire\n*Blood Lad\n*Vampire Knight\n*Diabolik Lovers\n*Dance with the Devils\n\n===Music===\nVampire music usually include Baroque rock, Dark Ambient music, Industrial, [[Goth]], and anything that conveys a dark and moody atmosphere.\n\n'''Playlists'''\n\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4ELqraXx-U&list=PLc_slNkfJzjZvSv2_FvhZYGWJkVPDxwNC&index=7 Best Baroque Pop songs 2018 by Nymphya]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EV3WbRnIf4&list=PLLqoar0BgGGS4nqN3-qgP9dT6Qy-g9dXi Baroque Rock by Rain\u2022Bow]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7kF7dVNi1T7xVdNapSXpHU?si=rYrtg7vdSMS3QHBu9Lo8Jg VAMPIRECORE / VAMPCORE by 10.28 Productions]\n*[https://www.tunefind.com/show/a-discovery-of-witches A Discovery of Witches soundtrack]\n\n'''Artists'''\n\n* Playboi Carti\n*Lady Gaga\n\n==Subgenres==\n\n===Lesbian Vampire===\nThe Lesbian Vampire aesthetic carries a lot of the Vampire tropes, but adds a lesbian subtext to the vampire/prey dynamic. It originated with the novel ''Carmilla'' by Sheridan Le Fanu.\n\n=== Vampire Lifestyle ===\nVampire lifestyle is a term for a contemporary subculture of people, largely within the [[Goth]] subculture, who consume the blood of others as a pastime; drawing from the rich recent history of popular culture related to cult symbolism, horror films, the fiction of Anne Rice, and the styles of Victorian England. Active vampirism within the vampire subculture includes both blood-related vampirism, commonly referred to as ''sanguine vampirism'', and ''psychic vampirism'', or supposed feeding from pranic energy. Vampirism and the vampire lifestyle also represent a relevant part of modern day's occultist movements. The mythos of the vampire, his magickal qualities, allure, and predatory archetype express a strong symbolism that can be used in ritual, energy work, and magick, and can even be adopted as a spiritual system. The vampire has been part of the occult society in Europe for centuries and has spread into the American subculture as well for more than a decade, being strongly influenced by and mixed with the neo gothic aesthetics.<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vampire#Modern_vampire_subcultures</ref>\n\n=== Vampires and sexual themes ===\nAll the neck biting associated with vampires has led to vampire themed kink and erotica. Many popular Tumblr textposts about vampires make humorous references to the sexiness of biting. Posts about finding vampire boyfriends and girlfriends by knocking on the door of an ancient castle during a rainstorm are also popular.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nVampire aesthetic.jpg\nVampire aesthetic 1.jpg\nVampire aesthetic 2.jpg\nVampire aesthetic 3.jpg\nVampire aesthetic 4.jpg\nVampire aesthetic 5.jpg\nVampire aesthetic 6.jpg\nVampire aesthetic 7.jpg\nVampire aesthetic 8.jpg\nVampire aesthetic 9.jpg\nVampire aesthetic 10.jpg\nVampire aesthetic 11.jpg\nVampire aesthetic 12.jpg\nVampire aesthetic 13.jpg\nVampire aesthetic 14.jpg\nVampire aesthetic 15.jpg\nVampire aesthetic 16.jpg\nVampire aesthetic 17.jpg\nVampire aesthetic 18.jpg\nVampiric.jpg\nBloodred.jpeg\nWine.jpg\nRed Candles.jpeg\nBloodlips.jpeg\n9b4d7ab60e264f61a9c3ae3e69e651e7.jpg\nGothic Academia.jpg\nVictorian goth1.jpg\nYveswon.jpg\nValerie week.jpg|Helena An\u00fd\u017eov\u00e1 in Valerie and Her Week of Wonders (1970)\nValerie 2.jpg|Helena An\u00fd\u017eov\u00e1 in Valerie and Her Week of Wonders (1970)\nValerie 3.jpg|Helena An\u00fd\u017eov\u00e1 in Valerie and Her Week of Wonders (1970)\nMonster1.jpg|Irene and Seulgi in Monster (2020)\nMonster 2.jpg|Irene and Seulgi in Monster (2020)\nMonster 3.jpg|Irene and Seulgi in Monster (2020)\nMonster 4.jpg|Irene and Seulgi in Monster (2020)\nDd1.png|Dracula's Daughter (1936)\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Visual]]\n[[Category:Fashion]]\n[[Category:Written]]\n<references />\n[[Category:Sexy]]\n[[Category:Creepy]]"}}}]}}}}
