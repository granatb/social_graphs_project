The term originally came from Eminem\u2019s song \u201cStan\" but the original negative meaning has evolved over time. \n\n''\"There are so many K-pop stans.\"'' \n\n'''Stan (v):''' To stan something means to passionately support and enjoy it, similar to fangirling/fanboying. \n\n''\"This group is so good, I should stan them.\"'' \n\n'''Bias (n):''' Your favorite member in a group.\n\n''\"All the members in 1TEAM are good, but I think Je Hyun is my bias.\"''\n\n'''Stream (v):''' To stream means to view it repeatedly to help increase the view count.\n\n''\"Stream Lit so it reaches 15 million views!\"''\n\n'''Koreaboo (n):''' A name given to non-Koreans who pretend to be Korean and worship Korean people.  It is a play on the term \"weeaboo\", which is used to describe a non-Japanese person trying to be Japanese. This term does not refer to normal K-pop and K-drama stans - Koreaboos are looked down upon in the K-pop and K-drama community due to their fetishization of Koreans and/or East Asians in general.<br />''\"Koreaboos are creepy people.\"''  \n\n==Fashion==\nK-fashion is usually characterized by kawaii fashion, pastel themes, long skirts and dresses, many accessories and Korean beauty trends. Koreawave is more of a fashion and media aesthetic. \n\nIdol fashion is inspired by the stage outfits that K-pop idols typically wear on stage during their performances. Since these styles are put together by stylists and each stage is styled specifically depending on the song and the concept, they take inspiration from nearly every fashion aesthetic. \n\n==Dramas and Movies==\nKorean Dramas have exploded in popularity in recent years, with international brands such as Netflix making them available to the general public outside of South Korea. Romantic dramas and Dramedies are the most popular of these shows. Movies are also a part of this aesthetic, both those originating within South Korea and the ones made by the Korean diaspora as a whole. Films such as the Oscar Winning ''Parasite'' have gained International Praise and entering the greater sphere of pop culture.\n\n==Music==\n'''K-pop''' is a\u00a0genre\u00a0of\u00a0popular music\u00a0originating in\u00a0South Korea. While the modern form of K-pop can be traced back to the early 90s, the term itself has been popularized since the 2000s, replacing the term\u00a0''Gayo'', which also refers to domestic pop music in South Korea. Although it generally indicates \"popular music\" within South Korea, the term is often used in a narrower sense to describe a modern form of South Korean pop that is influenced by styles and genres from around the world, such as\u00a0experimental,\u00a0rock,\u00a0jazz,\u00a0gospel,\u00a0hip hop,\u00a0R&B,\u00a0reggae,\u00a0electronic dance,\u00a0folk,\u00a0country, and\u00a0classical\u00a0on top of its\u00a0traditional Korean music\u00a0roots. K-pop often refers to the idol groups or idol soloists in Korea, though most K-music has now been categorized as K-pop.\n[[File:J-hope 'Daydream (\ubc31\uc77c\ubabd)' MV|thumb]]\nThe more modern form K-pop emerged with the formation of one of the earliest K-pop groups,\u00a0Seo Taiji and Boys, in 1992. Their experimentation with different styles and genres of music and integration of foreign musical elements helped reshape and modernize South Korea's contemporary music scene.\n\n*[https://open.spotify.com/artist/3Nrfpe0tUJi4K4DXYWgMUX?si=t8X1zCBFTnCDV4ASvCJc1Q BTS]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/artist/3cjEqqelV9zb4BYE3qDQ4O EXO]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/artist/2hRQKC0gqlZGPrmUKbcchR?si=eiW55i8-SuKnJaTGnUMYZw SHINee]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/artist/41MozSoPIsD1dJM0CLPjZF?si=UWCf-MXfRZuFlNUWMA8goA BLACKPINK]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/artist/7n2Ycct7Beij7Dj7meI4X0?si=wrc2a-qhS3qigO7_SEsglQ TWICE]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/artist/1z4g3DjTBBZKhvAroFlhOM?si=M6VsI8KYRIG4X7pKBDB61g Red Velvet]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/artist/6nfDaffa50mKtEOwR8g4df?si=diMy5SVYQiqb0_0WvfU2JA GOT7]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/artist/48eO052eSDcn8aTxiv6QaG?si=jZ5Ms_6URoisB5kjVzp8dA NCT]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/artist/2dIgFjalVxs4ThymZ67YCE Stray Kids]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/artist/2AfmfGFbe0A0WsTYm0SDTx (G)I-DLE]\n* [https://open.spotify.com/artist/5RR0MLwcjc87wjSw2JYdwx?si=qJAiPUn3TCmBjfQ1XYVpfg MOMOLAND]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/artist/4TnGh5PKbSjpYqpIdlW5nz?si=4N6U6fl2QgS9IAkzplRozQ Monsta X]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/artist/2PSJ6YriU7JsFucxACpU7Y?si=1EgW-9VPRaCdOcavT8F0uA Chung Ha]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/artist/68KmkJeZGfwe1OUaivBa2L?si=CYzqVqBxRySiUZ1FMKkQjA ATEEZ]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/artist/0Sadg1vgvaPqGTOjxu0N6c?si=jlZhFEkdRe-G8Ck9WSmxRw Girls' Generation]\n* [https://open.spotify.com/artist/0XATRDCYuuGhk0oE7C0o5G?si=hS9R4-NOQlqXVZZBN4FCaw Mamamoo]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/artist/52zMTJCKluDlFwMQWmccY7?si=lwnY_fboRe6V2wPJ2oLd8w LOONA]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/artist/3CVYSpM7nfHFG5qCTW7Ht9 ONEUS]\n*+ many more\n\n===Spotify playlists===\n\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1Ox3gOxl2LE1WH0B87WLxt?si=WOkG8rujRUuzTgsRNQtSqw KOREAN CAFE CHILL Spotify playlist by Akari Hiroshige]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2rfXtgFM3UipfMHWndRmZ2?si=cInL0Q5DR8mHHaLfvXrWew Korean R&B Spotify playlist by Thien Khong]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/747SWeTL6FPpY1iwtn9nHr?si=tblTdOgtQwu-XDjwSlQjRg K-Pop City Pop: Sounds of 80s Korean Pop Spotify playlist by 129030563]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3PgJwJRaiFBzFItOu5AgsK?si=Msb10osZQLmzuHVlbdb3YQ Korean Lofi/Chill Spotify playlist by warzbladez]\n* [https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4nEuv84VrFNcHmalTXUhAo?si=u-bIV1DcTEaCQi6PidQtNg Korean Rappers \ud83c\uddf0\ud83c\uddf7 Spotify playlist by Wilton Santos]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1aFLuBErmJclcO4DjfKwRi?si=BM4qw82UQwmuRrBrrPQ4Jw Korean Caf\u00e9 House Spotify playlist by sweetestkaren]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DX9tPFwDMOaN1?si=77KOt3iHQ3qaJ5wC1uU3ig K-Pop Daebak Spotify playlist by the fine folks at Spotify]\n* [https://open.spotify.com/playlist/76DeBBLp2FC54TPm5l7b4a?si=hrX56_dJQo2twdzZmURJiQ korean study chill Spotify playlist by Tricia C.
