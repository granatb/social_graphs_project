As a genre it blends the sound of\u00a0Western musical styles\u00a0such as\u00a0country\u00a0with that of\u00a0rhythm and blues,\u00a0leading to what is considered \"classic\" rock and roll. Some have also described it as a blend of bluegrass with rock and roll. The term \"rockabilly\" itself is a\u00a0portmanteau\u00a0of \"rock\" (from \"rock 'n' roll\") and \"hillbilly\", the latter a reference to the country music (often called \"hillbilly music\" in the 1940s and 1950s) that contributed strongly to the style. Other important influences on rockabilly include\u00a0western swing,\u00a0boogie-woogie,\u00a0jump blues, and\u00a0electric blues.\n\n== Fashion ==\nTheir are many parts to this aesthetic's fashion.

Psychobilly is often characterized by \nlyrical references to science fiction, horror (leading to lyrical \nsimilarities to\u00a0horror punk) and\u00a0exploitation films,\u00a0violence, \nlurid\u00a0sexuality, and other topics generally considered\u00a0taboo, though \noften presented in a comedic or\u00a0tongue-in-cheek\u00a0fashion. Psychobilly \nbands and lyrics usually take an\u00a0apolitical\u00a0stance, a reaction to the \nright- and left-wing political attitudes which divided other British \nyouth cultures.\u00a0It is often played with an upright\u00a0double bass, instead \nof the\u00a0electric bass\u00a0which is more common in modern rock music, and \nthe\u00a0hollowbody electric guitar, rather than the solid-bodied electric \nguitars that predominate in rock. Many psychobilly bands are\u00a0trios\u00a0of \nelectric guitar, upright bass and drums, with one of the \ninstrumentalists doubling as vocalist.\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery widths=\"130\">\n2Q.jpeg|A Psychobilly band\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Music]]\n[[Category:Visual]]\n[[Category:Needs work]]\n[[Category:Fashion]]\n[[Category:Plagiarized]]"}}}]}}}}
