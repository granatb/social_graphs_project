Babygirl encompasses sweet and innocent imagery and attitudes that give the adult wearer an overall childlike feel. The Babygirl aesthetic can vary from [[Babycore]] to [[Baddie]] to [[E-Girl]] or [[Pastel Goth]]. Often this can cross over with bratty attitudes and behavior; this means the sweet and submissive nature can morph into teasing, pouting, tantrums, entitlement, and a compulsion to challenge others. These childish themes allow the person to release typical adult stressors and fall into a more easy and comfortable state of mind as a stress relief technique sometimes known as age regression. Although, this aspect in its depth is not required or utilized by all in the community and is reliant on individual preference. The main purpose of this aesthetic, seperate from the sexualized sect, is to allow adults to feel and reclaim childhood wonderment and comfort, and to also overcome obstacles from abuse (similar to [[Traumacore]]'s purpose) and heal while still maintaining a more matured sense of style and dignity. Be advised when searching terms related to this aesthetic as the results <u>will</u> show explicit content aimed at adults 18+.      \n\n==Visuals==\nVisuals for babygirls lie on a vast spectrum under the cute, feminine umbrella. This ranges from baby and toddler motifs to traditional adult feminine silhouettes and beauty standards. Many visuals are colored pink or any pastel color, usually traditionally feminine colors.The SFW visuals include but are not limited to:\n\n*Baby toys like stuffed animals and blocks\n*Pacifiers\n*Coloring books\n*Glitter and sparkles\n*Playgrounds\n*Flowers\n*Esteem/confidence building, mental health art\n*Frilly beds and bedrooms\n*Pigtails\n*Relationship motifs like handholding, hugging, and knee sitting\n*Candy\n*Cartoons\n*Harnesses and garters\n*Fur, leather, and lace\n*Plastic and/or sparkly jewelry\n*Cutesy vintage imagery similar to Nymphette\n\n==Subgenres==\n\n===Babycore===\nThis is a more commonly seen type of Babygirl, they tend to be much more soft spoken and tend to be clingy sometimes. This attitude of Babygirl can consist of sweet, and needy. Visuals have a distinct crossover with babycore and angelcore, opting for the softest and sweetest themes like clouds, cherubs, candy, blankets, teddy bears, pacifiers, flowers, and much more.  \n\n====Fashion====\nThe \"Babycore\" side of the Babygirl aesthetic tends to wear flirtier, pastel clothing, and younger clothing. Some staples include:\n\n* Lacy socks/lingerie\n*Barrettes\n*Miniskirts\n*Shorts/co-ords\n*Mary Janes/sneakers\n*Jelly shoes\n\n<br />\n===Baddie===\nUnlike the \"Babycore\" side of the Babygirl, this aesthetic is less [[babycore]] and more of a softgirl/baddie mix. This means it's less cutesy and more chic. Baddie Babygirls may be more bratty, but still childlike at heart. This type often has visuals relating to makeup, playgrounds, Barbie dolls, and Bratz.  \n\n====Fashion====\nSimilar to [[baddie]] fashion but with more light girly colors.\n\n*Uniform skirts\n*Tight coords\n*Tights\n*White Air Forces\n*Graphic tees\n*Mini skirts\n*Hair clips\n*Cute accessories<br />\n\n===Dark===\nThis the Babygirl style that tends to prefer darker colors than the typical Babygirl would enjoy. Often darker imagery is associated with this side as well, like weaponry, chains, and cute devil-esque figures. They may act like brats like the Baddie side would yet can still be sweet and small. This can encompass everything previously stated about Babygirls, just with darker colors and themes, although pinks and light colors are still used. This can be similar in style to [[E-Girl]], [[Pastel Goth]], or [[Kinderwhore]] with visuals stemming from these as well. This can include weapons with sparkles, nighttime, pink-hued photographs, roses, chains, and much more.   \n\n====Fashion====\n\n*Dark Sweaters\n*Dark miniskirts/skater skirts\n*Thigh high socks\n*Fishnets\n*Chunky heels or Mary Janes\n*White sneakers\n*Chokers\n*Chains\n\n==Music==\n\n===Artists===\n\n*Melanie Martinez\n* Lana Del Rey\n*Marina and the Diamonds\n*Ariana Grande\n*blackbear\n*Halsey\n* Doja Cat\n*Poppy<br />\n\n==Criticism==\nThis aesthetic is often criticized for it's romanization of pedophilia due it's origins in DDLG (Daddy Dom/Little Girl), a BDSM subgenre that allows submissive partners to take on an innocent, childlike role which the dominant acts as a caretaker. This role-play dynamic is not uncommon and quite popular among some internet subcultures. The titles/terms are even used in relationships outside if the genre, as they originated sometime in the 1950's as pet names for couples. However, a large population believes that this aesthetic goes too far by sexualizing innocence, father-daughter relationships, and behavior common in children. This can create a dangerous scenario similar to that of the [[Nymphet]] aesthetic, wherein underage girls may perpetuate this sexualization and/or become victims of it. Often times, this community is lumped in with \"MAPs\" (minor-attracted persons aka pedophiles) and is often demanded by users on social media sites like Tumblr to not view their individual content. The existence of this aesthetic in tandem with DDLG can increase the predation and acceptance of predation on young girls, which can only be stopped by the intelligent, careful, and watchful eyes of the community. \n\nThe vast majority of babygirls and members of the community are aware of the connotations associated with it and are the first to speak against its links. The DDLG community itself outright denounces all pedophilic notions and associations, and is swift to reject and condemn those who partake in such atrocities. The community prides itself in maintaining the standard of consensual, legal roleplay between sane adults in a safe environment. The purpose behind the DDLG community is described as <u>\"''...exploring and enjoying the headspace of a younger person. It\u2019s about experiencing the world through new eyes and enjoying a relationship in a different way''</u>[https://lovegasm.co/blogs/kink/ddlg-psychology-and-controversy \"] and doesn't always include sex. There are some who <u>\"''use it to reclaim childhood abuse or neglect and get to experience the \"ideal\" childhood they missed out on in a safe environment with people they can trust.''</u>''[https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/80uq1i/cmv_ddlg_is_creepy/ \"]'' Some say it can be freeing to allow another person take care of you as if you are younger, it can allow someone to express themselves in their own true way, and can strengthen a loving relationship with their partner through a trusted power exchange. The babygirl aesthetic derives its philosophy from these ideals of trust, freedom, individuality, and healing. \n\nMany may use the aesthetic for visuals' and fashions' sake alone, choosing to reject the sexual notions of DDLG, as the other aspects of the aesthetic are enough to draw attention and attraction. It is valid to enjoy the visuals, cute fashions, and personalities of this aesthetic without fully engaging with the extended community. If you choose to adopt this aesthetic, it is imperative to understand the connotations and perceptions that come with it. If you still like the style but do not want to be involved due to the controversy or are not of adult age, alternatives to this aesthetic include [[Babycore]], [[Baddie]], [[E-Girl]], [[Lil Girl]], [[Pastel Goth]], [[Sanriocore]], or [[Softie]]. Be safe, aware, and smart. \n\n==Resources==\nAll resources are safe for work but may discuss the sensitive aspects.\n\n===Educational Videos===\n\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGB5D8mi7kk&ab_channel=EvieLupine DDLG & CGL vs. Ageplay]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAYmfAQ5S3U&ab_channel=BinkiePrincess What DD/lg is NOT]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cC6dIDG3-g&ab_channel=milkwebs CG/l & pedophilia]\n\n===Playlists===\n\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7M68gSWVdopPhsrfKcwZeq songs that turn girls into materialistic babygirls\ud83d\udc8b] by Maria San Juan\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/34CHCp2LhDHG9ceBUHWgml babygirl] by lottie <3\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/34Iwznmi0deO5WeroLHBLA daddy issues/ddlg] by Lari \ud83d\udc31\u200d\ud83d\udc09\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37MOdZcSYLQxEJpDTjRK9K Babygirl] by araceligonzalez44\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6canwQQkLI3TkxUI3JNDx5 Little Space] by That1PersonThatEatsAllYourFood\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0bu4TjAXGZXFVkdTgXPZYy i'm in love with my teacher] by Lizzie Roads\n\n===Pinterest Boards===\n\n*[https://www.pinterest.com/Lady_Hydra/babygirl/ Babygirl by Lady Hydra]\n*[https://www.pinterest.com/shedabaddieb/babygirl/ { babygirl } by ~kelsey~]\n*[https://www.pinterest.com/KarenSoppa/a-babygirl-collection-%E1%B4%97%CB%AC%E1%B4%97/ \u1d43 \u1d47\u1d43\u1d47\u02b8\u1d4d\u2071\u02b3\u02e1 \u1d9c\u1d52\u02e1\u02e1\u1d49\u1d9c\u1d57\u2071\u1d52\u207f (\u2741\u1d17\u0348\u02ec\u1d17\u0348) by\u2661 \ud835\udce2\ud835\udcfd\ud835\udcfb\ud835\udcea\ud835\udd00\ud835\udceb\ud835\udcee\ud835\udcfb\ud835\udcfb\ud835\udd02\ud835\udcd5\ud835\udcea\ud835\udcf2\ud835\udcfb\ud835\udd02 \u2661]\n*[https://www.pinterest.com/thisbitch_is_h0rny/babygirl-aesthetic-/ \uff22\uff41\uff42\uff59\uff47\uff49\uff52\uff4c \uff41\uff45\uff53\uff54\uff48\uff45\uff54\uff49\uff43\uff0d by # \u0aee\u208d \ud81a\uddb9 \u02d5 \u00d7` \u208e\u10d0 ! \ud83d\uddef\ufe0f\u00b7YOU DID THIS FOR WHAT?]\n*[https://www.pinterest.com/Niyah_246/babygirl-aesthetic/ Babygirl Aesthetic by Niyah]\n*[https://www.pinterest.com/deerwithearrings/pastel-babygirl-aesthetic/ Pastel Babygirl Aesthetic by Nell]\n*[https://www.pinterest.com/emma_alejado/babygirl-aesthetic/ Babygirl aesthetic by Emma]\n*[https://www.pinterest.com/stopitdammit/baby-girl/ Baby Girl by stopitdammit]<br />\n\n==Gallery==\n\n===Babycore===\n<gallery orientation=\"square\">\nItgirl-shop-gray-pink-school-style-grand-plaid-pleated-aesthetic-skirts-3691131732003 1200x1200.jpg\nBaby-girl-fashion-skirt.jpg\nBaby-girl-shirt-pink.jpg\n8178878ceac9c474319a1d1a4dcc7e7b.jpg|Melanie Martinez Babygirl Style|link=Babycore\nBbybirl-white-harness.jpg\nBbygirl-coord.jpg\nBbygirl-overall.jpg\nBbygirl-toes.jpg\nBbygirl-sweater.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n===Baddie===\n<gallery widths=\"185\">\nBaddie.jpg\nBratzcore 6.jpg\nBaddie-baby-girl-fur-skirt.jpg\nBaddie-baby-girl-baby-phat.jpg\nBaddie-babygirl-neon-sign.jpg\nBaddiegirl.jpg\nCapture.PNG\n77BE7FA3-E7B7-410A-B834-CD8DB6669E9E.jpeg\nGlitteryeyes.jpg\n</gallery><br />\n\n===Dark===\n<gallery widths=\"185\">\nSocute.gif\nDark-baby-girl-fishnet-skirt-pink.jpg\nDark-baby-girl-chunky-heels.jpg\nDark-baby-girl-socks.jpg\nDark-baby-girl-pants-pink-black.jpg\nDark-baby-girl-shorts.jpg\nBbygirl-black-top.jpg\nBbygirl-black.jpg\nDark-bbygirl-dumb.jpg\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Visual]]\n[[Category:Fashion]]\n[[Category:Sensitive Content]]\n[[Category:Feminine]]\n[[Category:Sexy]]\n[[Category:Youthful]]\n[[Category:Recognized Community]]"}}}]}}}}
