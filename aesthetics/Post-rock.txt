That's what post-rock is about. Bands often have long names and even longer songs with dark, apocalyptic, but also cathartic moods. This genre of music usually has no lyrics, but lyrics can be used to evoke a symbolic and darker meaning when further investigated.\n\nImportant bands in the genre include:\n\n* Godspeed You! Black Emperor\n*Slint\n* Sigur R\u00f3s\n* Explosions in the Sky\n* Mogwai\n* God Is An Astronaut\n* Thee Silver Mt. Zion Memorial Orchestra\n* Set Fire To Flames\n* Esmerine\nHere are some example songs from the genre.\n* ''Your Hand in Mine'' by Explosions in the Sky\n*''Good Morning, Captain'' by Slint\n* ''\u00c1g\u00e6tis byrjun'' by Sigur R\u00f3s (both the album and the song)\n* ''Take Me Somewhere Nice'' by Mogwai\n\n== The Post-rock aesthetic ==\nPost-rock aesthetics seem similar to [[Goth]] and [[Emo]]. Beyond their melancholic, downbeat nature, and their preference for black, these similarities are however superficial. As a rule, Emo and Goth are more angsty and depressed, while Post-rock is more cathartic and submissive.\n\nPost-rock visual and musical aesthetic often focuses on evoking a feeling that is both apocalyptic yet reassuring at once, both soul-crushing yet liberating.\n\n== Albums ==\n<gallery widths=\"175\">\nThee-Silver-Mt-Zion-Fuck-Off-Get-Free-We-Pour-Light-On-Everything-608x608-340x340.jpg|Three Silver Mt.
