It can be divided into two subaesthetics, each of which looks vastly different - '''High Cleancore''' deals with the adult world and products aimed at adults, such as washed-out soaps and sterile hotel rooms, while '''Low Cleancore''' deals with products aimed at children, such as bath toys and rubber ducks.\n\nAs a continuation of many of its predecessors, Cleancore cynically embraces capitalist imagery. Yet at the same time, taps into its anxiety-stricken audience, becoming a particularly popular aesthetic to try and achieve during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n== High Cleancore ==\n{{Aesthetic|title1 = High Cleancore|image1 = High cleancore.jpg|decade_of_origin = 2010s|key_motifs = Cleaning Sprays, Soaps, Sponges, Sterile Environments, Laundry Pods, Clean Water|key_colours = Pale Blue, White, Mint Green|related_aesthetics = [[Icepunk]]<br>[[Medicalcore]]<br>[[Poolcore]]<br>[[Vacation Dadcore]]<br>[[Vaporwave]]|other_names = Safetycore, Safetygoth}}High Cleancore take a more adult approach to the Cleancore aesthetic, sharing elements with [[Vacation Dadcore| Poolcore]], [[Icepunk]], and even a little bit of [[Vaporwave]] in terms of embracing capitalist imagery in a cynical manner.\n\n=== Visual ===\nHigh Cleancore has a very sterile, clean feel with a heavy focus on soap, water, deodorant, detergents, hand sanitizers, and various other forms of clearners and can overlap into the realm of [[Medicalcore]] with some of the aesthetics to create a cold, sterile image (which leads to Cleancore and Icepunk sharing similar colors).\n\n=== Fashion ===\nHigh Cleancore fashion usually consists of the type of things worn while cleaning something or being in a clean environment. This includes surgical and gas masks, rubber gloves, hospital gowns, scrubs, and reflective vests.  \n\n=== Music ===\n* [https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7EV7KHQv1OWTbHgjxQRz5N?si=5mZUeQ_nTFqoL56Bju_SWg Cleancore Spotify playlist by Daniel J Chang]\n* [https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6jpZ4SUizA6T4ewwdgf5xt?si=94FyaPaiRRaZe1NtapJ32g CleanCore Spotify playlist Fredy Januarta]\n* [https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5efTmdpwsCeKuBm9OMZcuv?si=K4Cui86mRCCszn7VSlG1qw cleancore Spotify playlist by \u3072\u308d\u304d]\n* [https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0gzcxWfZT98pL8CoszdvPv?si=0-rQTcK4S6CKoOVJsRUkpg CLEANCORE Spotify playlist by Victor Rodriguez]\n* [https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7BUOgFJuxAuggfe3ApexwV?si=xFrx9wUTQ-WmniDm2I7Esg no bore chore Spotify playlist by Suh Ling]\n\n=== Gallery ===\n<gallery widths=\"170\" orientation=\"square\" spacing=\"small\">\n57326299 134035217682404 630775820462175984 n.jpg\n7943616ff08db059cded3169e331c15f.jpg\nTumblr oszorfgQon1tcg4xno1 400.jpg\n50607f71c7363f61b34ed48c47c643c2.jpg\nToothbrush.jpg\nTumblr pl0fli83AU1y0ns5so1 500.jpg\nIMG 1294.JPG.jpg\nCleancore fashion.jpg\nCleancore fashion2.jpg\nCleancore1.jpg\nCleancore2.jpg\nCleancore3.jpg\nCleancore4.jpg\nTumblr pde86zhWbK1x3wtddo2 400.gif\nTumblr pq2xorbb5W1xjdnqyo1 640.png\nTumblr pq1gchVOgq1s7eamy 1280.jpg\nTumblr pq1gcieOWU1s7eamy 1280.jpg\nSurrealcore.jpg\nCleancore.jpeg\nWashwashwash.jpg\nCleancore Soapy Water.jpeg\nCleancore Blue Soap.jpeg\nFood.jpg\nBubble_bath.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==== Korakrit Arunondchai's ''Letters to Chantri'' ====\n''Letters to Chantri'' is a 2016 video and art installation by Thai artist Korakrit Arunondchai. The installation consists of a series of sterile mannequins dressed in white and a fountain in front of the video projection. Nearby, there is also a large pile of white soap bars, each bar being in a plastic package.\n\nThe video's visual aesthetics are inspired by the controversial ''Dhammakaya'' variety of Thai buddhism, which cultivates a strictly clean, white aesthetic in its temple visitors. With its lengthy depictions of bubbles, water, washing (Arunondchai washing large amounts of paint of his body and becoming clean), and soap bars (a central motif in the video), ''Letters to Chantri'' can be considered the first Cleancore artwork that has been in museums and was later donated to the ''City Museum for Contemporary Art'' (S.M.A.K.) in Ghent, Belgium.
