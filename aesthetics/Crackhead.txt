The term is very popular on Tumblr and among\u00a0school kids. The aesthetic has no relations with actual drugs.\n\nChaos and signs of dumbassery can be found everywhere, and so can spilled foods, chipped fingernails, wet socks, lost wallets, unbrushed hair, disorganized workspaces, etc, which are all examples of the eternal presence of a Crackhead.\n\n==Visual ==\nMany of the visual examples of the Crackhead aesthetic show messy rooms or houses, but this is not the entire idea of this aesthetic. Some other examples show people doing strange or foolish activities or pictures that might make you question their existence. Some of these ideas may have some aspects of [[Weirdcore]].\n\nCrackhead\u2019s sole purpose is to confuse you. In many ways, this aesthetic is a pain to look at, especially for perfectionists. This might be because of its uncountable imperfections.\n\nThe messy room part of Crackhead is unique to this aesthetic, but the items in the mess and how big the mess is might be similar to [[Trashcore]].  Other Crackhead visual aesthetic cues include:\n\n*Disorganized rooms\n*Random items on the floor\n*Strange activities\n*Confusing photos\n*Misplaced garbage\n\n==Fashion ==\nCrackhead fashion is generally very casual and comfy, including sweatpants, baggy clothing, stained clothing and often accompanied by highly fashionable accessories such as smartphones with broken screens.  The style is very urban, similar to [[Grunge]] fashion and dollar store clothes.\n\nColors often associated with Crackhead are red, symbolizing the blood shed by a stubbed toe, yellow, for your pee (because you haven't been drinking enough water!!), brown, for that sauce you spilled on your shirt, black and gray.\n\nCrackhead fashion is less about what one wears, but what one ''does'' with what one wears, but the general theme is chaos, chaotic and confusing get-ups, while not necessarily cursed.\n==Media==\n\n===Movies and TV ===\n\n*''America's Funniest Home Videos''\n*''Cops''\n*''Jackass''\n\n===Music===\n\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7EGZS1g3W4KMToof6rvqUX?si=lFIkuVykQaa69jiYLS5fVA CrAcKhEaD eNeRgY Spotify playlist by allie_griese]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2orvY75nr1WTdJLnlTXif7?si=QIH1hBZ3Soa_vLG0nZPzmg crackhead tingz\u270a\ud83d\udc4a Spotify playlist by alicestrandell]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0C7RXgRcbgAYQwESEOSjhd?si=X2eMPqC5Qx20CRji7DCptQ crackhead anthems Spotify playlist by Olivia Malou Foged Schmidt]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3ctlTUUSsryzAXDevoAXKi?si=vOsS97spQKilLwKnYMDenQ Crackhead hours >;0 Spotify playlist by Vanessa Correa]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4XDrL0cdqBsDqIdhJRt5Lx?si=YS-UsgVMTRaFdfV9Ca6wog cRaCkHeAd eNeRgY Spotify playlist by jesskim43]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3LNBM5Sop39Uhvth0ZyYcR?si=cnCjcfKRTHO7ioyRe0OYxA CrAcKhEaD HoUrS Spotify playlist by ~hibahanwar~]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/77q8rcCJtCMHUbzTVfJBWo?si=FERdKspBR1OiuanA6MWmyQ crackhead hour drives Spotify playlist by Ishika Nayyar]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2eBHiT3sMX4KH1p81bT9do?si=JKHBXRo3SpWKyaHMxvSefA crackhead  Spotify playlist by Xoxogee]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7EYAzT6CfLZ13X8bACqzAL?si=vKwPwwxuQbG3m2AgL1tz_A im a crackhead ayeee\ud83e\udd74\ud83d\uddff\ud83d\udc97 Spotify playlist by maryah!!!]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6SHBQwNhqopGepFsBaP4pd?si=05JSb95ZRTKb7uigqG4OkA crackhead music \ud83d\udc96 Spotify playlist by Grey]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0SXPBALQrOokKKKur6NEuo?si=QpUqRb1ESv6qH6ZXgaNX2Q \ud83d\udc93mf crackhead vibe check\ud83d\udc93 Spotify playlist by Jackie Scrine]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1V6gJwFkHnllaLFju0GIDx?si=wtnFIjT1RFy-UjZQYjo4Gw Aesthetic Crackhead Spotify playlist by Harrison Tonks]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2bisKacS0B0ykTow5Jg2Rw?si=R77rUElZRZ6774Xpybv7Eg Crackhead Shit Spotify playlist by Jenna]\n\n*[https://open.spotify.com/user/te1wa6zpnmi13xcsgm6ssbng2/playlist/4HntqxMzjNqAmye6k0hvM7?si=duBmN_ufSnWjdLXOo16fnQ Chaoscore - Spotify playlist by Haunt]\n\n*[https://open.spotify.com/user/22zxkl4t33cmlxz4zzkw2fora/playlist/3YxsViYFTCm1WjZ0NFIhb3?si=y4ca515nSV-kEiyWHWWnXg CHA\u00d6SC\u00d6RE - Spotify playlist by HellBoiSeven]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/user/bwxah1gqmb8oktem7mm41r8ie/playlist/5KDXnQUNP3LOCTppZyyJFq?si=8iuejAnsQeCnHe_K9T1jzQ cHaOsCoRe - Spotify playlist by Turtle]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/user/sandlokk/playlist/5iapCJbNpkBrhrW4BHoeeg?si=lo43i4aKQNOvFzubT6L54g chaoscore - Spotify playlist by layla]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2qfuKFNzHRacBEAf4Pd1Y6 BRITANY SPEARS - TOXIC by poorguythatmanjohnthomas]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4qfwgAXZUsWf4NImSxRWBx The Salt and Pepper Diner by Chivesy]\n\n==Subgenres==\n===Dumbass Memer===\n'''Dumbass Memers''' are members of the Crackhead community who also enjoy [[Surreal Memer|Surreal Memes]]. Dumbass Memers are known for their ironic and often nonsensical sense of humor and social commentary while retaining all aspects of their Dumbass nature.\n<br />\n===Bastardass===\n'''Bastardass''' is the fusion of Crackhead and [[Bastardcore]]. Bastardass merges both the cursedness and fight-or-flight-activating elements of Bastardcore and combines them with the equally chaotic, clumsy but lovable traits of a Dumbass.\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"130\">\nMessyhair.png|The meme of the doll with messy hair qualifies as Crackhead.\nTrash with legs.jpg\nWeeb knight.jpg\nTh (6).jpeg\nDnwmDulWkAAIlHM.jpg\nLego mess.jpg\nWhat a mess.jpg\nChaos 6.jpg\nJessica Hess The Chaos Aesthetic Hashimoto Contemporary.jpeg\n19 Pictures That Pretty Much Perfectly Sum Up Being High.jpeg\nCool Kids Never Sleep via Tumblr on We Heart It.png\nTwitch & aesthetics ; kth & jjk.jpeg\nToilet paper room.jpg\nChaotic door.jpg\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Visual]]\n[[Category:Fashion]]\n[[Category:Music]]"}}}]}}}}
