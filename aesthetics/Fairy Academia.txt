It is a combination of an identified and a created aesthetic wherein the main inspiration and visuals are based on a series of inter-related events and design movements, but was created in that categories relating to lifestyle and the music associated with the aesthetic are unrelated to the original Victorian/Edwardian time period, such as the grunge elements listed in the music section.\n\n<br />\n\n== Visual ==\n\n*Victorian fairytale ephemera\n*Ballet visuals\n*Victorian and Renaissance-era paintings\n*[https://youtu.be/cH_rfGBwamc Hole - Violet (Official Music Video)]\n*[https://youtu.be/S2SmHALECBw Country Love - Mono (Official Music Video)]\n\n==Written==\n\n*''Picnic at Hanging Rock'' by Joan Lindsay\n*''A Little Princess'' by Frances Hodgson Burnett\n*''The Secret Garden'' by Frances Hodgson Burnett\n*''Peter and Wendy'' by J.M.
