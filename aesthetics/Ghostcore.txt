Ghostcore involves two different factions, one takes focuses on death and the philosophy behind the meaning of life and death, and the other faction takes the macabre and depressing and makes light of it. People may often relate to ghosts or wish to live as one. This provides a similar overlap with [[Voidpunk]], and is a part of the otherkin community.  \n\nThe aesthetic of ghostcore is described as \"dark, haunted, and ethereal-like landscapes, cemeteries, the spiritual world and connecting to it, haunted artifacts, dark and mysterious history, legends and ghost stories, and more\" according to a private Ghostcore Facebook page. The community is open, casual, and accepting of all who are accepting of them.  \n== Visual ==\nGhostcore plays into trying to send a chill down the viewer's spine or make the viewer uncomfortable in a way. It is meant to portray some sort of \"fall from grace\" or tragedy. Often times, photo subjects appear dirty, damaged, or decayed. \n\nThings that fall under this category are:\n\n* Victorian paintings\n* Mansions or castles\n* White out eyes or itch black eyes\n* White sheets\n* Handprints or fingerprints\n* Forests\n* Children or children's toys\n* Bathtubs or sinks\n* Vintage objects\n* Fog\n* Flowy things\n* Dried flowers and plants\n* Wind blowing through your hair and clothes\n* The moon\n* Candles\n* Mirrors\n\n== Activities ==\nExamples of ghostcore activities (as described by Tumblr user sleepysheepsy) include:\n\n* Feeling chilly\n* Staying in one place for a long time\n* Speaking in a quiet voice\n* Being easily scared, but stays brave \n* Being out at night\n* Love receiving compliments\n* Swaying back and forth\n* Being gentle\n* Being scared of the dark, or super comfy with it\n* Shy but loves talking with close pals\n* Feeling invisible\n* Watching things\n* Hiding and playing hide and seek\n* Admiring your reflection\n\n== Fashion ==\nGhostcore fashion can be open to the interpretation and comfort to any individual, as this is not a fashion-centric aesthetic. However, the community has been open in discussing various fashion tastes and intrigues which include:\n\n* Flowing, lightweight gowns and fabrics\n**Typically in white or black\n\n* Suits and formalwear as if attending a funeral\n* Vintage and Victorian-esque fashions\n* Hoodies\n* Comfy socks\n* Sneakers\n* Military boots\n* Leggings\n* White sheets\n\n== Media ==\n=== Manga ===\n* Ghost Hunt\n*Cemetery Zero\n\n=== Songs ===\n\n* ''bury a friend'' by Billie Eilish \n* ''Teddy Bear'' by Melanie Martinez \n* ''Freak'' by Sub Urban\n* ''Cirque'' by Sub Urban\n* ''Panic Room'' by Au/Ra\n* ''DEATHWISH'' by poutyface<br />\n== Resources ==\n\n=== Communities ===\n\n==== Reddit ====\n\n*[https://www.reddit.com/r/Ghosts/ ''r/ghost'']\n*[https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/ ''r/nosleep'']\n*[https://www.reddit.com/r/horror/ ''r/horror'']\n\n==== Tumblr ====\n\n*[https://www.tumblr.com/search/ghostcore /ghostcore]\n*''[https://cobblestone-ghost.tumblr.com/post/646379274982621184 Sleeping in the Mausoleum]''\n*''[https://that-shadow-in-the-back.tumblr.com/post/646315338756161536/theres-something-about-fog-that-makes-me Sorry to be ghosted]''\n*''[https://fettfleisch.tumblr.com/ Hi]''\n*''[https://phantasmagothic.tumblr.com/ Good old-fashioned abditory]''\n*''[https://teenlore.tumblr.com/ creep shit]''\n\n=== Pinterest Boards ===\n\n*[https://www.pinterest.ph/isabellaquiambao/ghostcore/ \u2764GHOSTCORE\u2764]\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery widths=\"185\" orientation=\"square\">\nEyes.jpg\nLets start a cult guys.jpg\nA Nice Guy.jpg\nHmm.jpg\nSad bride.jpg\nMore sad bride.jpg\nYoshiki.jpg\nKids.jpg\nMirror.jpg\nCoven.jpg\nHuh.jpg\nGhost-gaurdian.jpg\nGhost-painting.jpg\nGhost-roof.jpg\nGhost-sheet.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n* \n\n[[Category:Core Suffix]]\n[[Category:Visual]]\n[[Category:Needs work]]"}}}]}}}}
