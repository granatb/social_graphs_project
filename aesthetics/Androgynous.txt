Androgyny may be expressed with regard to\u00a0biological sex,\u00a0gender identity,\u00a0gender expression, or\u00a0sexual identity. The different meanings of androgyny point to the complex\u00a0interrelationship\u00a0between aspects of sex, gender, and sexuality. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n== Visual ==\nAndrogynous-based visual aesthetics center around a complete rejection of the gender binary in favor of letting individuals be able to freely express themselves without fear of being attacked for it.\n\n=== Pinterest Boards ===\n[https://www.pinterest.com/mariecat71725/androgynous/ Androgynous by Maggie.M]\n\n== Fashion ==\nAndrogynous people\u00a0dress or style themselves to look neither typically male nor female. In the past,\u00a0androgynous fashion\u00a0has held a huge stigma, with its ties to the feminist and LGBTQIA communities. The androgynous style usually dresses with pants or shorts. It is also commonly found in people who identify as a non-binary gender.\n\nSome 'androgynous fashion staples' would be things such as\n* Loose, black, geometric clothing (these clothes' popularity has grown so much that it's sometimes labelled under the nu-goth aesthetic)\n* Kilts. Surprisingly, these were once very popular queer-punk staples\n* Capes and hoods, particularity ones that can be worn in multiple different ways\n* Science fiction references are also very popular here, using things such as shiny fabrics and futuristic hairstyles and makeup looks\n* Men's watches - they're classy and, if you get the right type, they can look cyberpunk\n* Oxford shoes are very versatile and go with any outfit, whether it's enby, feminine, or masculine\n\n[https://www.townandcountrymag.com/style/fashion-trends/g30538059/androgynous-clothing-brands/ Here] is a link for some androgynous brands, if you are curious on where to find these clothes. \n\n<br />\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery widths=\"130\">\nBbe7baf86fafbd61cfa1701301dea9eb.jpg\nIm.jpeg\nAndrogynous academia.jpg\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Fashion]]\n[[Category:Visual]]\n[[Category:LGBT+]]"}}}]}}}}
