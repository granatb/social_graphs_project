This aesthetic gives off colorful and playful vibes, similar to Kidcore. This aesthetic got slightly popular with younger children and teens from the 2010s to today. One of the most iconic things from this aesthetic was the viral Unicorn Frappuccino, which was available at Starbucks for only a few days in April 2017. This aesthetic spreads positivity for everyone. Unicorncore is also about magic, purity, pride, diversity, freedom, innocence, healing, positivity, joy, and hope.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis aesthetic is also about finding unicorns, Magic books, and myths about unicorns. Magic can play a fun part in Unicorncore, as Unicorns are mythical and magical creatures. People who like this aesthetic love quiet spaces, magical areas, nature, flowers, rainbow paths, and trees. This aesthetic also has interests in reading, bright colors, glitter, sparkles, and flowers. \n\n== Visuals ==\nMost visuals consist of sparkles, glitter, and anything else relating to the average unicorn visual. Colors like purple, pink and rainbow/pastel themes merge with these visuals to create the unicorn core aesthetic. Virtually every unicorn core aesthetic picture has a unicorn in it, showing the purpose of the aesthetic.\n\nDifferent subgenres can show different visuals too, like Grunge Unicorn*, which mixes darker colors like black and grey with average unicorn core colors (i.e. white, pink, and rainbow). A unicorn can also appear in these sub-visuals, be it a drawing, mask or altered image fitting the grunge visual. You can learn more about these sub-visuals in the sub-genre section.\n\n<br />\n\n== Fashion ==\nUnicorncore fashion can be very colorful and fun, full of sequins and glitter. A common part of Unicorn outfits is denim, be it denim shorts or a denim jacket to go with a colorful shirt or skirt. Many younger children have this fashion style, but any age is fine!\n\n*galaxy patterns\n*pastel patterns\n*denim shorts\n*pullovers\n*pastel or rainbow sweaters\n*pastel pajamas\n*unicorn kigurumi\n*pastel rainbow tutu\n*dresses\n*unicorn hoodies\n*pastel holographic\n\n<br />\n\n=== Accessories ===\nAccessories are an iconic part of Unicorncore fashion, adding a touch of fun and magic to your outfit.
