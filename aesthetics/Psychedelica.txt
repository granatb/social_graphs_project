'''Psychedelic art''' and music typically recreate or reflect the experience of altered consciousness. Psychedelic art uses highly\u00a0distorted,\u00a0surreal\u00a0visuals, bright\u00a0colors\u00a0and full\u00a0spectrums\u00a0and\u00a0animation\u00a0(including\u00a0cartoons) to evoke, convey, or enhance the psychedelia experience. '''Psychedelic music''' uses\u00a0distorted\u00a0electric guitar,\u00a0Indian music\u00a0elements such as the\u00a0sitar,\u00a0electronic effects,\u00a0sound effects\u00a0and\u00a0reverberation, and elaborate studio effects, such as playing tapes backwards or panning the music from one side to another.\n\n\n\n== Art ==\nAdvances in printing and photographic technology in the 1960s saw the traditional\u00a0lithography\u00a0printing techniques rapidly superseded by the\u00a0offset printing\u00a0system. This and other technical and industrial innovations gave young artists access to exciting new graphic techniques and media, including photographic and mixed media collage, metallic foils, and vivid new fluorescent \"DayGlo\" inks. This enabled them to explore innovative new illustrative styles including highly distorted visuals, cartoons, and lurid colors and full\u00a0spectrums\u00a0to evoke a sense of altered consciousness; many works also featured idiosyncratic and complex new fonts and lettering styles (most notably in the work of San Francisco-based poster artist Rick Griffin). Many artists in the late 1960s and early 1970s attempted to illustrate the psychedelic experience in\u00a0\u00a0paintings,\u00a0drawings,\u00a0illustrations, and other forms of graphic design. In the modern era,\u00a0computer graphics\u00a0may be used to produce psychedelic effects for artwork.\n\n== Music ==\nThe fashion for psychedelic drugs gave its name to the style of psychedelia, a term describing a category of\u00a0rock music known as\u00a0psychedelic rock, as well as\u00a0visual art,\u00a0fashion, and\u00a0culture\u00a0that is associated originally with the high 1960s, hippies, and the\u00a0Haight-Ashbury\u00a0neighborhood of\u00a0San Francisco,\u00a0California. It often used new recording techniques and effects while drawing on\u00a0Eastern sources\u00a0such as the\u00a0ragas\u00a0and\u00a0drones\u00a0of\u00a0Indian music.\n\n'''Psychedelic rock''' is a subgenre that was influenced by the effects of LSD. Psychedelic rock was about depersonalization, and a sense of having your head in the clouds. Psychedelic aimed to evoke euphoria, and became synonymous with peace movements. Bands with this label ranged from Cream and The Jimi Hendrix Experience, to later Beatles, The Doors and The Rolling Stones. Psychedelic rock become popular within hippie groups, especially during events such as the Summer Of Love during the 70s, therefore being associated with the Vietnam War era. Unfortunately, the Vietnam War would continue on, and so psychedelic rock quickly stagnated as other genres replaced it. Regardless, psychedelic rock would be influential, and would surprisingly go on to be one of the main influences of the [[Metalhead|heavy metal]] subgenre. Today, psychedelia still lives on as a genre (eg. neo-psychedelia), though it is not as popular as it once was.\n\n== Playlists ==\n\n* [https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0mmkT2soKEcJvDmvUwUEoO AESTHETICS: psychedelica by Chaotic Good]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5VESOC6rZg0ToR6dWkOPB8?si=6d1fa3660ea94e21 songs for levitation by 10.28 Productions]\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery widths=\"185\">\nQuantumpunk-Kaleidoscope.jpg\nPsyched-out.jpg\nEye-rainbow.png\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Visual]]\n[[Category:Music]]"}}}]}}}}
