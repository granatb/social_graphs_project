Usually characterized by the decline of technology, abandoned cities full of wildlife. The surviving humans would be focused on food, shelter, and having to work together as a community rather than fighting or having to deal with whichever world ending event may be occurring. The technology they have might be solar, wind, or other renewable energy sources. \n\n== Philosophy ==\nPictures in this style look abandoned and seem as if they've been that way for years now. This can inspire feelings of hope, dread, meaninglessness and hatred for this world as it is right now. Using the feeling of collapse of today's society, the aesthetic focuses on the positivity of the world being a cleaner and generally happier place after the apocalypse. This works especially well since today's capitalistic society is so unfocused on doing anything to stop climate change from progressing the way it is and other similar pollution based issues.\n\n== Visuals ==\nThe visual features of soft apocalypse are very reliant on nature surrounded urban environments. These environments will often include concrete, brutalist architecture, skyscrapers, large buildings and subway stations. They're also very bland in appearance, in comparison to the bright moss, lichen or trees which surround the once urban area.\n\n*concrete\n* brutalist architecture\n* moss and lichens\n* trees\n* urban environments\n* clear sky\n* dereliction\n\n==Media==\n\n===Books===\n\n*'The Eleventh Plague' by [https://www.jeff-hirsch.com/ Jeff Hirsch]\n*'Soft Apocalypse' by [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_McIntosh Will McIntosh]\n*'Earth Abides by [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_R._Stewart George R.
