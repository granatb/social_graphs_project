This can range from loose standing crystals, beads, embellishments, jewelry, and much more. Minerals have been found in many locations all over the world and many have associated meanings and alleged special properties. Different cultures and communities vary in beliefs of the special properties crystals may have. Communities and entities that utilize crystals for these meaning range from [[Witchy Academia|witches]] and pagans for use in practice to misguided claims they work better than medicine. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n== Visual ==\nCrystalcore visuals focus, obviously, on crystals. It's one of the few aesthetics that, alone, can be very beautiful and magical, but it can only be accentuated by blending with other aesthetics, especially the more colorful aesthetics (given the variety of colors that can crystals can come in) or magical aesthetics (given the association of some crystals with the supernatural) though that's not to say it can't blend with aesthetics that don't fall under those categories. Crystalcore can also be seen very frequently in [[Icepunk]], [[Seapunk]], Pearly, and [[Vaporwave]] in particular, given the ethereal nature of the three (and Icepunk in particular deals with ice, which can take on a crystalline appearance itself).\n\nAs for entertainment associated with Crystalcore, one can either watch the [https://www.youtube.com/user/jewelrytelevision JTV] channel on YouTube or Steven Universe on Cartoon Network\n\n== Fashion ==\nCrystalcore fashion follows the example of the crystal; bright, colorful, and shiny. Because of this, Crystalcore fashion can borrow very heavily from [[Raver]] and [[Y2K]] fashions, but also incorporate a lot of jewelry (or rhinestones, if you're on a budget) into the overall look. So if you own any shiny or shimmery clothing items you can wear Crystalcore fashion. Holographic items work just as well, as well as anything beaded or embellished. \n\n<br />\n\n== Media ==\n\n=== Anime & Manga ===\n\n* Houseki no Kuni\n* Sacred Seven\n\n=== Cartoons ===\n\n* Steven Universe\n\n== Music ==\nA lot of Crystalcore music can have a \"glittery\" sound like you're walking through an ice cave or into a room covered in shiny jewels. A lot of [[Synthwave]], Chillwave, [[Vaporwave]], and [[Seapunk]] music can evoke this sort of feeling, as well as a lot of [[New Age]] music.\n\n== Mineral Varieties ==\nHere's a list of some of the most popular mineral varieties<ref>https://www.gia.edu/gem-encyclopedia</ref>: \n\n* Alexandrite\n* Amethyst\n* Ametrine\n* Aquamarine\n* Citrine\n* Diamond\n* Emerald\n* Garnet\n* Iolite\n* Jade\n* Kunzite\n* Lapis lazuli\n* Moonstone\n* Morganite\n* Opal\n* Peridot\n* Rose quartz\n* Ruby\n* Sapphire\n* Spinel\n* Sunstone\n* Tanzanite\n* Topaz\n* Tourmaline\n* Turquoise\n* Zircon\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery widths=\"130\">\n223294405-quartz-crystal-wallpaper.jpg\nGiphy8.gif\nGiphy7.gif\nGiphy6.gif\nOriginal2.gif\nTenorcrystal.gif\nLight-crystals.jpeg\nAmethyst.jpeg|Amethyst is an especially popular crystal.\nCXlpghIUEAAcRAq.jpg\nIny.png\nPink_cc.jpg\nCc.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n== References List ==\n<references />\n[[Category:Visual]]\n[[Category:Core Suffix]]\n[[Category:Fashion]]"}}}]}}}}
