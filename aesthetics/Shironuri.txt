Popular fashions among the wearers of this make-up are [[Goth]][[Lolita|, Lolita]], [[Mori Kei]], and [[Angura Kei]]. The make-up centers around wearing a white foundation and white powder that often also goes down the neck. Heavy black eyeliner is very common as well as decorative lashes. The lips are often reshaped in extreme styles, ranging from small hearts, no lip-look, to stitched up mouth corners.         \n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery widths=\"135\" spacing=\"small\" orientation=\"portrait\">\nShironuris.jpg\nShironuri9.jpg\nShironuri8.jpg\nShironuri3.jpg\nShironuri2.jpg\nShironuri7.jpg\nShironuri6.jpg\nShironuri4.jpg\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Fashion]]\n[[Category:Japanese]]\n[[Category:Needs work]]\n[[Category:Candidates for Deletion]]"}}}]}}}}
