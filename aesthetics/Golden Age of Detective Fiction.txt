The plots revolve around upper class characters and murder. It centers around the dichotomy between the elegance of the European elite and the savagery and blood that comes with the events of the story. Feelings of suspense, interesting characters with different backgrounds, and glamorous settings are major components of this aesthetic.\n\n== History ==\nThe characters in these mystery stories are often members of the British landed gentry, or else their servants. Although England is the most common setting, these mysteries can take place in any part of the British Empire, such as India or Australia. Although the time period is usually between the 1920s and 1930s, the popularity of the genre led to it being adapted to suit more modern times. Activities such as hunting, cocktail parties, and travel via ship and steam train remained largely unchanged for several decades that followed.  \n\nExotic elements, such as the story taking place in jungles or deserts, tropical animals, and non-European artifacts can also be incorporated due to the British Empire's influence. Many stories revolve around characters who are colonial authorities, explorers, archaeologists, and travelers. Please note that because of the time period, the depictions of the native people are often ignored or racist due to the prejudice of the time period.  \n\nThe visual and story tropes arose from the popularity of authors such as Agatha Christie.  Many mystery writers that followed were inspired by the works of these earlier writers, and certain elements of the plot, the settings, and character types are repeated by mystery writers to this day. Parodies of this aesthetic can also be found in more recent works, such as the game Clue, and the Doctor Who episode, \"The Unicorn and the Wasp.\"  \n\nElements of works from the Golden Age of Detective Fiction, such as the female amateur detective and tightly knit community of characters influenced the '''Cozy Mystery''' genre. These mysteries are sometimes seen as formulaic and over-done but are popular among those who prefer \"clean\" mysteries where violence is of screen, there is very little profanity, and sex is usually not even discussed. The Cozy Mystery genre is not limited to the time period of the 1920s-1930s, although some mysteries are set during that time period.  \n\nA lot of the imagery is connected with Gothic literature and horror, but the main story and visual component is free of supernatural components in favor of showing the motives of the criminals that started the events of the plot. The nobility being the perpetrator can also serve as a critique of their over-indulgence and greed. It also shares visual tropes and some story components with [[Dark Academia]], but does not involve learning and explicitly takes place among non-students.<br /> \n\n== Visuals ==\n\n* Antique rifles\n* Blood\n*Cigars and smoking\n*Decor typical of aristocratic houses, such as suits of armor and portraits\n*Dinner parties, with multiple courses and traditionally wealthy foods such as Beef Wellington and foie grois\n*Detective paraphernalia such as magnifying glasses and fingerprint powder\n*Egyptian artifacts\n*Exotic animals such as jaguars and lions, often used as \"murder weapon\"\n*Fashionable clothing and jewelry indicative of the upper class, i.e. pearls\n*Hunting paraphernalia such as taxidermy, hunting dogs, and tranquilizer darts\n*Leather-bound books and private libraries\n*Liquor, a good medium for poison and blurred memories\n* Manor houses, often in remote areas\n* Oak paneled walls\n*Oriental rugs\n*Puzzle boxes and hidden rooms\n*Poison\n*Secret messages\n*Steam engine trains\n*Storms\n*Swords, knives, and daggers\n*Unspecified \"oriental\" artifacts, often Turkish, Indian, or Chinese\n\n=== Typical Character Types ===\n\n* Academics \n* Adventurers, typically clad in pith helmets and the \"colonizer uniform\"\n* Businessmen, either stuffy or hedonistic\n* Butlers, servants, and maids. \"The butler did it!\" is a common accusation\n* Femme fatales\n* \"Great Detective\" such as Hercule Poirot.
