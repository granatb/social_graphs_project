The aesthetic is mostly based around the common outfits and activities of a maid, but does change depending of the type of person.  It is also seen in anime as well as cosplay and fan art, even tying into different cultures, most commonly in Japan.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== <u>France</u> ===\n'''French maid''' was a term applied in the Victorian and early 20th century periods to a lady's maid of French nationality. A lady\u2019s maid was a senior servant who reported directly to the lady of the house, and accompanied her mistress on travel. She helped her mistress with her appearance, including make-up, hairdressing, clothing, jewelry, and shoes, and sometimes served as confidante. A maid of French nationality was considered likely to be more expert in current fashions, and was also able to apply her knowledge of the French language when travelling in Europe.\n\nErotic fantasies revolving around young French women later led to the appearance of French maids as desirable and stereotypical soubrette characters in burlesque dramas and bedroom farces.\n\nThe term ''French maid'' is now often applied to an eroticized and strongly modified style of servant's dress that evolved from typical housemaid's black-and-white afternoon uniforms of 19th-century France, despite a housemaid being junior to a lady\u2019s maid. Some styles are conservative while others are revealing. The French maid costume is often used in cosplay, sexual roleplaying, and uniform fetishism. Depending on design details, some forms can be classified as lingerie.<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_maid</ref>\n\n=== <u>Japan</u> ===\nThough popular and well known in mainstream media, many relate maid culture in Japan to otaku culture due to its being history and frequency of being used as a common trope in anime and manga.\n\n'''Maid cafes''' were start due to the popularity of maids in various forms of media. A cosplaying themed restaurant, these cafes are where you can find female servers (usually late teens to mid twenties) dress as maids while tending to patrons. The common attire for the staff is that of a French maid, though there can be other themes (i.e.: Victorian style, Modern-traditional kimono mix and Cat maid) as well.  You can order both food and services from menus provided; these services are '''non-sexual'''. Guests must adhere to the rules of the caf\u00e9 or else they'll be escorted out. Akihabara was the first city to host a permanently established maid caf\u00e9 in 2001. A male form of this style of restaurant, Butler caf\u00e9s, exists as well.<br />\n\n== Media ==\n\n=== Literature ===\n'''Manga'''\n\n* Emma (also an anime)\n* Kikaiji Kake no Marie\n* Maid-sama (also an anime)\n* Ookami Ryoushu no Ojou-sama\n* Shirley\n\n=== Music ===\n\n* [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJToUvYrmkmTCR-bluEaQfA Band-Maid]\n** (Sub Unit) Band-Maiko\n\n* [https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4mFKgpONjU7rysaFBZV1Hc?si=aa6af495cb124569 Maidcore - playlist by vladislav1454 | Spotify]\n\n=== Fictional Characters ===\n\n* The Maid (From the Clue board game and movie)\n\n== References ==\n[[Category:Needs work]]\n[[Category:Core Suffix]]\n[[Category:Candidates for Deletion]]"}}}]}}}}
