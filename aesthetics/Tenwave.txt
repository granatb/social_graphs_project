It consists of a critique/parody/satire of cultural products of the 2010s, seeing them as decadent and trashy, remembering with nostalgia and better eyes those of previous eras with the exception of a few. \n\n== Visuals ==\nOn a visual level, it combines some elements of Vaporwave, such as the use of glitch effects for example, with the surrealistic aspect of the Acidwave and the colors of the Milleniwave.\n\n== Music ==\n'''Tenwave''' music takes inspiration from genres such as Vaporwave, [[Trillwave]], Vaportrap and Chopped and screwed'''''.'''''\n\nFrom Vaporwave, Tenwave would take the use of samples ''(although in this genre they would be samples of the music of the decade of the 2010s, specially pop music)'' and its effects such as slowed + reverb. From Trillwave it would take that imperfect touch that it has. In the case of samples that lack drums, the rhythms of trap from the Vaportrap would be incorporated (adding to these Vaporwave effects) From Chopped and screwed, it would take all the elements it has, with the exception of reducing the tempo to 60 - 70 bpm, Since its rhythms would be between 80 and 90 bpm.\n\nOther influences will be slowed + bass edits, [[Psychedelica|psychedelic music]] and [[shoegaze]].\n\n* [https://archive.org/details/by-piem-ion._202106 ''\ud83c\udd74\ud83c\udd7d\ud83c\udd73 \ud83c\udd7e\ud83c\udd75 \ud83c\udd83\ud83c\udd77\ud83c\udd74 \ud83c\udd86\ud83c\udd7e\ud83c\udd81\ud83c\udd7b\ud83c\udd73 by Piem I\u00f3n ( First Tenwave song )''] \n\n== Fashion ==\nIn terms of fashion, Tenwave would take influences from Milleniwave in combination with the [[Hippie]] aesthetics of the 60s and some [[Cyberpunk]] touches. Elements of children's cultural products from the 2010s would also be present in the clothing. \n\n== Philosophy ==\nThe philosophy of the Tenwave movement can be summarized in a single phrase: \"my past was always better\". The world is so screwed up, the only thing I have left, is to mock and protect myself in the past and the good memories I have.\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nFile:1619509969273.jpg\nFile:1619682255465.jpg|1618129645782.jpg\nFile:1618129645782.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n[[Category:Wave Suffix]]\n[[Category:Music]]\n[[Category:Music]]\n[[Category:Fashion]]\n[[Category:2020s]]\n[[Category:Created Aesthetic]]"}}}]}}}}
