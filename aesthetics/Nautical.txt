This aesthetic also includes or relates to a ship tied up to the dock.  This aesthetic gives the feeling of being at sea or on the ocean or relaxing on a boat or a yacht. Elements that can be included in the Nautical aesthetic include:\n\n* The ocean and beach\n* Boating\n* Salty air\n* Turtles\n* Dolphins\n* Seagulls\n* Docks and boardwalks\n* Lighthouses\n*Beach houses\n\n== Fashion ==\nThe fashion aesthetic often involves a navy jacket with brass buttons, a crisp white sailor's uniform, a sou'wester hat, and yellow slicker, or a fisherman's sweater. Historic traditions in nautical dress continue to influence modern nautical apparel. When it comes to nautical dressing, blues, stripes, and sweaters are staples for a reason. Their look reflects the essence of what it should look and feel like to be on the sea.  A lot of Resort wear can also be included in Nautical fashion. Items, colors, and patterns tend to include:  \n\n* Shades of blue, green, black, white, light pink, and cream colors\n* Iridescence\n* Scale patterns\n* Loose fitting clothing\n* Transparent and translucent materials\n* Dresses\n* Skirts\n* Clothes featuring themes and motifs related to the sea\n* Cardigans\n* Beachwear\n\n== Activities ==\nThis aesthetic brings out a calming lifestyle, so most of the time you can find yourself doing these activities:\n\n* Surfing\n* Shopping locally\n* Reading by the beach\n* Boating\n*Hanging out on a yacht\n\n== Media ==\n\n=== Movies ===\n\n* Song of the Sea (2014)\n* Outer Banks (2020)\n* Moana (2016)\n* Life of Pi (2012)\n* Ponyo (2008)\n\n=== Music ===\n\n==== Spotify Playlists ====\n\n* [https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5tf6ejRdKrNA3pwQfSGX8Z Seaside vacation Spotify playlist by pinksandposies] \n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery widths=\"130\" orientation=\"none\">\nNautical5.jpg\nNautical6.jpg\nNautical7.jpg\nNautical9.jpg\nNautical10.jpg\nNautical11.jpg\nNautical12.jpg\nNautical13.jpg\nSeacore Fish.jpg\nSeacore ocean waves.jpg\nSeacore Surfing.jpg\nSeacore Beach House.jpg\nSeacore sea.jpg\nSeacore Person.jpg\nSeaglass2.jpg\nMy Post (4).png|Aesthetic Collage (Fashion Based)\n</gallery>\n\n[[Category:Fashion]]\n[[Category:Visual]]\n[[Category:Needs work]]\n[[Category:Oceans and islands]]\n[[Category:Official Name]]"}}}]}}}}
