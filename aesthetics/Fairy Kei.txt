It began with Tavuchi, founder of the vintage and repurposed vintage boutique SPANK!, as her personal style, and then the look took off from there. \n\nFabric is usually lightweight for dresses and skirts, such as the loose A-line dresses and the fluttery colored petticoats. Thick, fluffy sweaters, over-sized 80's sweatshirts; this is also the land from whence comes the mokomoko accessories craze, and stuffed animals are sewn onto sweaters and scarves, or as the usual purse. Dress length can be ankle length, knee-length or mini-skirt length; anything fluttery and flowy works. \n\nThe most important aspects of fairy kei are the vintage/fantasy world factor, and the color palette. Color is one of the most important features here, less so the structure or item. Pastels and neon-tinted pastels, or high-saturated pastels. Popular colors are pastel pink, baby blue, lavender, light yellow and in smaller doses, \u2018white-with-black-dots\u2019. Dark and overly bright colors are not allowed outside of accents. Several motifs and themes are often found in fairy kei as well: most notably the unicorn, followed by kittens, any vintage 80's toy or franchise, moons and stars, rainbows, and naturally sweets such as cotton candy and conversation hearts (the chalky American candy that say things like UR CUTE).\n\n\n== Subgenres ==\n[[File:1438005251014.jpg|thumb|Uchuu Kei]]\n=== Uchuu Kei ===\nThis substyle of fairy kei has a focus on outer space (uchuu) and space alien (uchuujin) motifs. The outfits combine the typical pastel look with flurescent colors and artificial/PVC materials. The make-up can be anything from simple to very colorful and often features unusual lipstick colors. Accessories often include space helmets, fluffies/vinyl legwarmers, headbands and futuristic headphones.\n\n'''Vendors'''\n\n*[https://aikafuture.theshop.jp/ Aika Electronics]\n*[https://www.kissmekillme.fr/ Kiss Me Kill Me]\n\n<br />\n==Resources==\nExternal links to help get a better understanding of this aesthetic.\n\n=== Communites ===\n\n* [https://www.reddit.com/r/fairykei/ Reddit]\n\n===Blogs===\n\n*[https://fairy-tips.tumblr.com/ Fairy-Tips]\n\n===Vendors===\n\n*[http://shop.phooey.jp/ Fancy Surprise]\n*[https://hanamizz.fashionstore.jp/ Hanamizz]\n*[http://www.nile-jp.com/ Nile Perch]\n*[https://pinks215.official.ec/ Pink Strawberry]\n*[http://www.shop-online.jp/spank/ Spank!]\n\n===Playlists===\n\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2fuZF2ZXjtv3sihuPv4DMl?si=ywTCcDX2RPS7YoIdZhuwiw Fairy Kei Spotify playlist by Charlie]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5TBMPTwkTBcIZfPh0YWCtg?si=rGPJqbqTQReP9CTVxhYR6Q Fairy Kei Vibez Spotify playlist by haddietennenhouse]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1H2Vq8Zi1vySINjrYDEGNP?si=KnpbwJdxSbqqREo0fUIXDA fairy kei || electronica mix Spotify playlist by missmusicallymadhatter]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7tXCqRJuqTeEY9BXGR0YF6?si=lk1-aApyREayMN8vTJy0ZA \ud83d\udc39\u2728 Super Fairy Kei \u2728\ud83d\udc39 Spotify playlist by martinsthree]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2Wnxzm8JlQWNzKwBA1OvxT?si=NK-5qYcyTvKuPNzBubg-sA \u2728\ud83c\udf20 fairy kei \ud83c\udf1c\u2728 Spotify playlist by Shaun Canidae]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/31U6DJzVRjtC1KmXWnM9Wf?si=K2mHcDDtQd-zPRgMGKjHSQ foreign iceberg Spotify playlist by Tori Matrix]\n\n==Gallery ==\n<gallery widths=\"135\" orientation=\"portrait\" bordercolor=\"#fb7cb4\">\nTumblr inline o5kzxesSyb1rt6vmv 400.png\nTumblr inline orusnqJJYH1rt6vmv 500.jpg\nTumblr n329lhZBp21tuvg5eo1 1280.jpg\nTumblr 73818d6ac952428202b2ffc56c49ee16 df51a13b 1280.jpg\nTumblr lneoo4XK5S1qzf91vo1 500.jpg\nFairy-kei.jpg\nFairy kei girl.png\n171739130 4048749628519994 8375032320709029083 n.jpg\n4b2e74ed-9b54-4d53-989f-e00db7fd60e5.jpg\nTumblr p0tmibBIf51r77xpdo1 640.jpg\nFairy kei girl 2.jpg\n87c7688a.jpg\n1438315295128.jpg|Uchuu Kei art\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Kei Suffix]]\n[[Category:Fashion]]\n[[Category:Japanese]]\n[[Category:Needs work]]\n[[Category:Feminine]]\n[[Category:Cute]]\n[[Category:Youthful]]"}}}]}}}}
