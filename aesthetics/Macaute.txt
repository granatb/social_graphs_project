An artist who has made the Macaute aesthetic particularly popular is Jack Stauber, but possibly the earliest example of these aesthetic would be the classic Flash animation ''Happy Tree Friends''.\n\n==Fashion==\nMacaute fashion may take a lot of inspiration from [[Kidcore]] or [[Scene]] fashion, but can mix it with some gory, bloody, or viscerally disturbing elements in order to achieve the jarring effect that Macaute strives to go for.\n\n==Music==\nMost media in macaute consists of artwork, music, etc but it can come in other forms as well.
