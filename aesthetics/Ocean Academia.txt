This involves specializations such as oceanography, marine biology, marine archaeology, ocean engineering, hydrology, naval architecture, etc.\n\nThis aesthetic mainly centers around one's passion for learning about the deep ocean, sea mythology, marine life, and mysteries of the abyss. At a deeper level, it signifies a quest for self-discovery, meaning of life, and emotional peace.\n\nThis aesthetic is not derived from any particular culture, society, trend, or period of time. Hence, it is more open to personal touches and individualistic desires. It is a romanticization of the ocean's depth and darkness, as well as the unknown that lies beyond. \n\n== History ==\nOcean Academia was created by SirenInTheBathtub for the Aesthetics Wiki.\n<br />\n==Philosophy==\nAt its heart, Ocean Academia aims to express the the inexplicable mystery that the ocean holds, its secretive yet inviting nature and the evocation of abstract emotions. The idea, regardless of whether it is understood, is to acknowledge and respect the ocean for what it is, a mystifying force of nature.\n\nFor the wanderers, lost souls, adventurers, non-conformists and seekers of truth- this is the aesthetic for you.\n\n==Visual==\nOcean Academia is found across various forms of arts such as photography, music, visual arts, literature, poetry, philosophy and architecture. Despite its broad definition, it carries a particular color palette that consists of blacks, dark and muted shades of blue, violet, grey and green.\n\nIt is intended to portray existentialism, hopelessness and the feeling of being lost. The ocean is vast, endless and intimidating. However, it is also deep and profound, and there is much we can learn from it.\n\n==Fashion==\n===Tops===\n\n*Black Chiffon Blouse\n*Black Lantern Sleeve Vintage Blouse\n*Black Turtlenecks\n*Sailor Collar Shirt\n*Motif Patterned Shirts\n*Dark Linen Shirts\n*Ocean Tie-Dye T-Shirt\n*Dark Bouffant Dresses\n*Dark Kurta/Kurti\n*Dark Silk Shirt\n*Iridescent Violets/Blues\n*Lacy Camisoles\n*Silk Button-Ups\n*Seigaiha Kimono\n*Fibre-Optic Gowns\n*Dark/Patterned Silk Ties\n* Mermaid Gowns\n\n===Bottoms===\n\n*Dark Lace Skirts\n*Dark Linen Pants\n*Black Dress Pants\n*Dark Ankle Pants\n*High Waist Pants\n*Sailor Skirts\n*Black Silk Pants\n*Black Midi Skirt\n*Dark Jeans (Frayed)\n*Mermaid Skirts\n*Fishnet Stockings\n\n===Outerwear===\n\n*Motif Blazers\n*Dark Corduroys\n*Black Overcoats\n*Black Formal Cape\n\n===Shoes===\n\n*Dark Brogues\n*Dark Doc Martens\n*Dark Ankle Boots\n* Formal Wedges\n*Brown Loafers\n*Longwing Blucher\n*Casual Sandals\n\n===Hairstyles===\n\n*Waterfall braid\n*Fishtail braid\n*Mermaid braid\n*Snake braid\n*Beach waves\n*Slicked back\n*Shaggy mullet\n\n===Accessories===\n\n*Silk scarves\n*Larimar, aquamarine, aragonite, pearl\n*Leather cord anklets with gemstones\n*Plain gemstone choker and rings\n*Gemstone earrings and bracelets\n*Silver piercings\n*Kraken/mermaid Tattoos\n*Trident/seashell/gemstone brooch\n*Vintage compasses\n*Fishnet gloves\n*Silver telescope\n*Blue/red coral necklace\n*Starfish/sea-spider hair clips\n*Black framed glasses\n*Black/blue/violet nail polish\n*Clear analog watches\n*Black neck ribbon\n*No socks\n\n==Media==\n===Books===\n\n*20,000 Leagues Under The Sea by Jules Verne\n*Moby Dick by Herman Melville\n*The Little Mermaid by Hans Christian Andersen\n*The Nightfarers by Mark Valentine\n*And The Ocean Was Our Sky by Patrick Ness\n* Walking on Knives by Maya Chhabra\n* The Blue Salt Road by Joanne Harris\n*The Little Homo Sapiens Scientist by S.L.

How can we imagine specific pictures, dresses or free-time activities? There are several sub-genres of this aesthetic which resolve the fact that water destroys books.\n\n* '''blue version of dark (or light) academia''': pearl accessories, waving blue silk robes, black, white and blue tapestry or furniture, paintings about the sea on the wall etc., otherwise nothing special: studying people, libraries, museums, books, literature, literacy...\n* '''vacation-of-the-librarian''': moodboards that contain reading persons on the beach, on the rocks of a seashore or on boats\n* '''Venice''': university cities built on the sea or lakes, where the streets are often canals, the residents do not walk but use gondolas or boats for transportation. Can be a historically accurate (Venice, Bruges, Wroclaw etc.) or fantasy environment.\n* '''wise mermaids''': fantasy subgenre where the entire 'landscape' is underwater and the intelligent species (mermaids, sirens, tritons, nixies, sea elf communities etc.) found a way how to write or perpetuate their knowledge in the deep\n* '''contemporary''': contemporary sub-culture of those scholars, oceanographers, researchers and artists who study the seas or inspired by the sea\n* '''futuristic''': a subgenre that supposes a future where cities are built on or under the sea. It can be an optimistic fiction close to solarpunk where mankind had learnt how to live in harmony with nature (The Deep - animation series) but can be a darker universe too e.g. like the post-apocalyptic Waterworld film (1995).  \n\n==Activities==\n===Sports===\n*Swimming\n*Recreational diving\n*Surfing\n*Underwater photography\n\n===Crafts===\n*Ocean documentaries\n*Mythology\n*Midnight research\n*Reading\n*Drinking tea\n*Cooking seafood\n*Collecting seashells\n*Philosophy books\n*Study underwater ruins\n*Obsessing over supernatural marine mysteries\n*Collecting marine fossils\n*History\n*Drawing marine anatomy\n*Foreign languages\n*Painting seascapes\n*Listening to deep sea ambience\n*Nautical Charts\n*Flute\n*Sea Poetry\n*Contemporary dancing\n*Journaling\n*Dreaming\n\n===Outings===\n*Art galleries\n*Museums\n*Theatres\n*Aquariums\n*Beach bars\n*Libraries\n*Bookshops\n\n*\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"185\">\n6b2881453f690316ec5268cefd8ef738 collage 450.jpg\nTumblr 0e4b2be9d263076de8b33bf13a6ad521 35725243 640.jpg\n038a0b1df959766d13ba72c86e0ef115.jpg\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Academia]]\n[[Category:Oceans and islands]]\n[[Category:Candidates for Deletion]]\n[[Category:Created Aesthetic]]"}}}]}}}}
