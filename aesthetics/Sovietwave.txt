Sovietwave is characterized by the romanticization of Soviet Utopianism and its vast ambition to unite humanity under the Socialist banner and to take it beyond the stars, untainted by capitalist decadence and hatred. Therefore, Sovietwave features Cosmonauts, Soviet Propaganda replications and other aspects of Soviet Futurism in its artworks and designs.\n[[File:Sovietwave3.jpeg|center|thumb|481x481px|Soviet space exploration is a major theme in Sovietwave, highlighting the promise of a theoretical socialist utopia.

Music is more likely to have a slower tempo than traditional [[Synthwave]] and New Wave to increase the sense of awe, but is much faster paced than [[Vaporwave|Vaporwave's]] more dream like tracks. Sovietwave thus ponders on what could have been, a bright future where the workers have taken to the stars rather than be subservient to greed. Considering that many of the adherents to this aesthetic were often born after the collapse of the USSR or were very young during it, much of the genre also draws on the feeling of nostalgia for a country and its vision that they never lived in, their only experiences with it being the nostalgia of their own parents who were likely Young Pioneer's believing in Communism's myth and run down monuments or propaganda built during the reign of Bolshevism. \n\nWhile not all Sovietwave musicians are ideologically Communist, the aesthetic tends to be sympathetic to Soviet perceptions of the future as well as the music it produced, particularly in the New Wave Era. Sovietwave musicians are therefore occasionally fond of splicing tracks from Communist politicians into their music, whether or not they unironically agree with the sentiments of said politicians. In any case, the genre is consistently fond of replicating Eastern European New Wave music, if not outright remixing classic tracks.\n\n== Distinction from [[Laborwave]]==\n[[File:Sovietwave2.jpeg|thumb|180x180px|An example of Sovietwave Aesthetics that draw from Laborwave's more dream-like features. However, the image is more interested in displaying Soviet might than abusrdism.]]\nSovietwave is not to be confused with the [[Vaporwave]] spin-off of Laborwave despite large degrees of overlap due to shared aesthetics of Communism and anti-capitalism. Laborwave is quite ironic and absurdist in its portrayal of Soviet and general Eastern Bloc nostalgia, while Sovietwave is almost entirely limited to the former USSR and is a more sincere form of nostalgia for the long gone Red Regime. Sovietwave tends to replicate Soviet utopian art earnestly, longing for the future that was promised, and is more fond of expressing awe at the might of the USSR, while Laborwave tends to make fun of such propaganda and grandiose expressions even if Laborwave adherents are unironically pro Communist. Furthermore, Sovietwave originated in the former USSR out of the general Russian internet's electronic Music scene with not all of it adherents being unironic Communists as opposed to Soviet nostalgics, while Laborwave's origins were across the entire internet's and the latter's adherents are more coherently Communist even if not Soviet nostalgic.\n\nThat said, there can be overlap, and Sovietwave can incorporate Laborwave's Vaporwave elements even though Sovietwave is more interested in grand myth of the USSR as a powerful entity.\n\n== Music ==\nSovietwave is closely tied to lo-fi, ambient, new wave and synth-pop. \n\n=== Notable Artists ===\n\n*\u0410\u0440\u0442\u0435\u043a \u042d\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0442\u0440\u043e\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430\n*Bicycles for Afghanistan\n*\u0411\u0443\u0435\u0440\u0430\u043a\n*\ufffc\u0412\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0439 \u044d\u0442\u0430\u0436 \u043f\u043e\u0440\u0430\u0436\u0430\u0435\u0442\n*\u0414\u0430\u0439\u0442\u0435 \u0442\u0430\u043d\u043a(!)\n*\u0414\u0443\u0440\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0432\u043a\u0443\u0441\n*\u041a\u0438\u043d\u043e\n*Kirov Reporting\n*lilii\n*\u041c\u0430\u044f\u043a\n*Molchat Doma\n*Motorama\n*\u041d\u0410\u0423\u041a\u041e\u0413\u0420\u0410\u0414\n*\u041d\u0430\u0443\u0447\u043d\u043e-\u042d\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0442\u0440\u043e\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u041c\u0443\u0437\u044b\u043a\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u041e\u0431\u044a\u0435\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \n*\u041f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u043c\u043e\u0442\u043a\u0430\n*\u041f\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0440\u043b\u0430\u0433\u0435\u0440\u044c \u041f\u044b\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0420\u0430\u0434\u0443\u0433\u0430\n*Ploho\n*\u041f\u0440\u043e\u0442\u043e\u043d-4\n*\ufffc\u0421\u0432\u0438\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435\n*STEREOYUNOST\n*\u0422\u0432\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u043e\u0437\u0435\u0440\u043e\n*\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\u0423\u0432\ufffc\ufffc\u0443\u043b\u0430\n*\ufffc\u0423\u0442\u0440\u043e\n*Chernikovskaya Hata\n*ssshhhiiittt!\n* \u042d\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0442\u0440\u043e\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430 302\n*\u042f\u043d\u043a\u0430\n*\u041c\u043e\u043b\u0447\u0430\u0442 \u0414\u043e\u043c\u0430\n\n=== Playlists ===\n\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMoCM_FgLP8&t=219shttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMoCM_FgLP8&t=219s Our Dream - Sovietwave Mix]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3KZ8qlL5IDYlR6oxQOrQ9Q New Soviet Wave Channel]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/48l32hxc2Zcm67YHX4epf1?si=ede1c1ba8d474ad9 \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u044f Spotify Playlist]\n\n== Gallery ==\n''Under Construction''\n\n== Further Reading ==\n\n* [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovietwave Wikipedia]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr-4umbnDgo What is Soviet Wave] by [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvKPc71Dd8qnuKZd2nRyH4g FlynnFlyTaggart] (Russian Only)\n*https://newsovietwave.com/\n*https://sovietwave.su/\n*https://onlineradiobox.com/ru/sovietwave/\n*https://tunein.com/radio/The-Soviet-Wave-s294800/\n\n[[Category:Music]]\n[[Category:Wave Suffix]]\n[[Category:Visual]]\n[[Category:Needs work]]"}}}]}}}}
