These images usually contain white or light pastel backgrounds that reflect off into rainbows. The objects/themes that are used often: holographic materialistic clothes, boots, bags, discs, crystals, marble floors, knives, sunglasses, jewels, shower tiles, glitter, mermaid merch, reflective water, the odd grid pattern, and edited swirled holographic. Holographic items are often confused with iridescent, multi-chrome, and any item with a shiny surface. They are different but can be confused with each other.\n\nSometimes, if paired with lyrics or quotes, they are usually from artists such as Lana del Rey, Marina and the Diamonds, The Arctic Monkeys, Melanie Martinez, Billie Eilish, and Lorde. These artists tend to sing about their current situation and emotions, creating a zone of in the now, absorbed in the now. They talk very poetically, describing experiences quite deeply and eclectically. Some examples are moments when you are loving someone, how disastrous and messy they are, and what they want to or are doing right now. The font is also not attention-grabbing, but a simple cute font, whereas the soothing shiny iridescence is the real attention grabber.\n\nYouTuber [https://www.youtube.com/user/simplynailogical SimplyNailogical] is credited for giving the subculture the title 'Holosexuals'. She frequently describes herself and her viewers and fans as \"holosexual,\" obsessing over shiny nail polishes.\n\n== Visual ==\nThere are two general subaesthetics in Holosexual visuals. Darker colors, black, and vibrant rainbow colors tend to be paired with sharp, [[Retro-Futurism|retro-futuristic]] and [[Futurism|futuristic]] visuals, while lighter colors, pastels, and silvers tend to be paired with small objects, especially jewelry and accessories. Both frequently feature patterns, fabrics, and lights.\n\nHolosexual visuals tend to be iridescent, color-shifting, glittery, and brightly colored. Common creatures seen in Holosexual aesthetics include unicorns, mermaids, and dolphins (especially in [[Seapunk]] aesthetics, which borrow from the Holosexuals).\n\n* Boots\n* Bags\n* CDs \n* Crystals\n* Jewels\n* Marble floors\n* Knives\n* Sunglasses\n* Shower tiles\n* Glitter\n* Reflective water,\n* Grid patterns\n\n== Fashion ==\nA majority of holosexual fashion is centered on make-up and nail polish, although there are examples of Holosexual clothing that exists out in the wild (and can even be bought on websites like Amazon). While most Holosexual fashion tends to skew towards more the feminine end of the gender spectrum, there are examples of male holosexual clothing out there, so the boys can have fun with this look, too. Holosexual fashion seems to be very common in [[Raver]] fashion, though some male holosexual fashion seems to take a lot of notes from '70s Disco fashion.\n\n=== Holosexual Fashion ===\n\n* [https://www.funstigators.com/ Funstigators]\n* [https://ivibed.com/ iVibed]\n* [http://www.iheartraves.com iHeartRaves]\n\n== Music ==\n* [https://open.spotify.com/artist/00FQb4jTyendYWaN8pK0wa?si=rnAygpxPS_-kP2-VarIAgw Lana del Rey]\n* [https://open.spotify.com/artist/6CwfuxIqcltXDGjfZsMd9A?si=Jr9r175XTHiXKkcAh_1MNA Marina and the Diamonds]\n* [https://open.spotify.com/artist/7Ln80lUS6He07XvHI8qqHH?si=SR_eT1DrRqCEUsgkouPq5A Arctic Monkeys]\n* [https://open.spotify.com/artist/63yrD80RY3RNEM2YDpUpO8?si=XiTCLtevT5Gw1flLblAPVw Melanie Martinez]\n* [https://open.spotify.com/artist/6qqNVTkY8uBg9cP3Jd7DAH?si=E_UETCatSXqnTvS5mNMn2Q Billie Eilish]\n* [https://open.spotify.com/artist/163tK9Wjr9P9DmM0AVK7lm?si=BdOeTZjzRf2xl4H3inEVPA Lorde]\n\n=== Spotify playlists ===\n* [https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6hRtrYQnEpbTa1QSEEfkKo?si=lqeR6NwHRJmI4TScK9l8Nw holosexual faves Spotify playlist by sanna]\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"130\" orientation=\"none\" spacing=\"small\">\nHolographic Moodboard.png\n313f6100dbe09e634883e664861005da.jpg\nAesthetic-holographic-purple-random-Favim.com-5062218.jpg\nD58b1b89163a7b7fa005c610300c508b.jpg\nDownload (4).jpg\n0ce34806c720f1bab5725b80d8510227.jpg\nFbd63979ebd5375fa0466b0ff9ff4280.jpg\nB25e8680bbb1a3cac183ca0584929ce8.jpg\nHolographic-Dance-Floor featured.jpg\nDorian Electra.jpg\nRestmyChemistry.jpg|link=https://www.redbubble.com/i/poster/REST-MY-CHEMISTRY-by-Maalavidaa/34525399.LVTDI|\"REST MY CHEMISTRY\" poster by Maalavidaa on Redbubble.\nSparklecore.jpg\nHolofancyroom.jpg\nFile:1630831382531.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n== Resources == \n=== Articles ===\n''Under Construction''\n=== Pinterest Boards ===\n*[https://www.pinterest.com/apineda2004/holosexual-stuff/ HOLOSEXUAL STUFF\u2764 by Ali Sofia]\n\n[[Category:Fashion]]\n[[Category:Visual]]\n[[Category:Music]]"}}}]}}}}
