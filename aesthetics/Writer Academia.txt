It is centered around the idea that writing is for everyone, and the quality of work does not matter as long as you are passionate about it and having fun. It is the romanticization of writing and literature, in any and all forms.\n\n\n\n\n==Activities==\n\n*Fake ads for your story\n*Flash fiction\n*[https://juliacameronlive.com/basic-tools/morning-pages/ Morning Pages]\n*Letters\n*Pitches for your stories \n*Writing<br />\n\n=== Other ===\n\n*Creating playlists for your WIPs\n*Making a Pinterest board for your book\n*Changing story perspective\n*Using creative writing prompts\n*Roleplaying written works with a friend\n*Host/join a writing club\n*Join a writing-based discord server\n*Draw your OC's\n*Making moodboards\n*Staying up all night writing\n*Developing a coffee/tea addiction\n* Making a list of words that you love\n*Writing and studying words on your hands at 3 A.M.\n*Losing yourself in fictional worlds\n*Creating new universes and wishing they were real\n*Having too many OC's\n*Carrying a notebook on your person at all times\n* Seeing things in your day-to-day life that remind you of your characters/world/book\n*Spending an absurd amount of money on writing programs and stationary\n*Becoming alarmingly attached to your OC's \n*Shipping your own characters\n*Drawing maps of your fictional worlds\n*Never letting people read what you're working on but itching to tell them everything about your characters\n*Constantly daydreaming\n*Procrastination<br />\n\n<br />\n==Podcasts==\n\n*Naked on Cashmere\n* Welcome to Night Vale\n*Around the Campfire: A Writing Workshop\n*The Writer's Voice    <br />\n\n<br />\n==Books==\n\n*''The Writer's Way'' by Julia Cameron\n*''The Writer's Way: Morning Pages'' by Julia Cameron\n*Writer's Digest magazine\n*''The Writer's Idea Thesaurus'' by Fred White\n*''Making a Literary Life'' by Carolyn See\n*''Bird by Bird'' by Anne Lamott\n*''On Writing'' by Stephen King <br /><br />\n\n==Artists==\n\n*Hozier\n*The Neighbourhood\n* Lorde\n*Gang of Youths\n*Lana Del Rey\n*Conan Gray\n*Bon Iver\n*Eden\n* The 1975 \n*Alec Benjamin   \n*Chilled Cow (Now \u2018Lofi Girl\u2019)\n*Arctic Monkeys\n\n<br />\n\n==Clothing & Fashion==\n''The Writer Academia style revolves around comfort and fashion, taking much inspiration from Dark Academia.''\n\n=== Tops ===\n\n* Dress shirts\n* Denim jackets\n* Turtlenecks\n* Plaid shirts\n* Oxford shirts\n* Light blouses\n* Large polo necks\n* Soft, comfortable sweaters (such as knitted or wool)\n* Blazers\n*Suit jackets\n*Trenchcoats\n*Overcoats    <br />\n\n=== Bottoms ===\n\n* Distressed jeans\n* Skirts\n* Plaid skirts\n* Dress pants\n* Plaid pants    <br />\n\n=== Shoes ===\n\n* Oxfords\n* Doc Martens    \n*Mary Janes<br />\n\n=== Accessories ===\n\n* Glasses\n* Silver or gold jewelry\n*Simple rings\n*Satchels\n*Belts that match your shoes\n*Watches\n*Sweaters tied over the shoulders\n*Undone or loose ties  \n\n<br />\n=== Other ===\n\n*Thick, comfortable socks\n*Knee-high socks\n*Reading socks\n*Wearable blankets/ponchos\n*Short, neat fingernails    <br />\n\n<br />\n== Stores ==\n\n*[https://www.barnesandnoble.com/ Barnes & Noble]\n*[https://www.dymocks.com.au/ Dymocks]\n*[https://www.chapters.indigo.ca/en-ca Chapters Indigo]\n*[https://www.etsy.com/ Etsy]\n*[https://us.moleskine.com/en/ Moleskine]\n*[https://youdecidewhoyouare.com/ You Decide Who You Are] (''poet'' collection)   <br />\n\n<br />\n==Writing resources==\n\n*[https://www.wattpad.com/ Wattpad]\n*[https://www.fanfiction.net/ Fanfiction]\n*[https://archiveofourown.org/ AO3 / Archive of Our Own]\n*[https://writershelpingwriters.net/ Writers Helping Writers]\n*[https://www.wordhippo.com/ Wordhippo]\n*[https://nameberry.com/ Nameberry]\n*[https://www.behindthename.com/ Behind the Name]\n*[https://nanowrimo.org/ NaNoWriMo]\n*[https://www.shewrites.com/ SheWrites]\n*[https://www.campfiretechnology.com/ Campfire Technology]\n*[https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener/overview Scrivener]\n*[https://app.grammarly.com/ Grammarly]\n\n\nFor extra resources not listed here, click [https://ryanlanz.com/writers-toolbox/ here.]\n\n=== Community & social media ===\nFeel free to add your favourite Writer Academia accounts here.\n\n*[https://www.instagram.com/writeracademia/ writeracademia (Instagram)]\n*[https://www.tumblr.com/blog/view/writeracademia writeracademia (tumblr)]\n*[https://discord.gg/AZSm3YPfHK Official Discord] \n*[https://www.instagram.com/_gabysena/ _gabysena (Instagram)]\n*[https://br.pinterest.com/silverz_/aesthetic/writer-academia/ Aesthetic \u2666\ufe0e Writer Academia \u2666\ufe0e by Silverz (Pinterest)]<br />\n\n<br />\n==Playlists==\n\n=== Spotify ===\n\n*[https://open.spotify.com/user/08jfd50okultjk9pbqzebjrpz/playlist/3zjsqxPf7s6FeWvRt68Zhb?si=J4Uf93R4QUihwTVvGn1N7Q writer academia.
