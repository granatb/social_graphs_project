It was pioneered by Claude Monet, Edgar Degas, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, and many others. Impressionist art was an impression of a painting; Impressionist works were first seen as unfinished paintings and significantly criticized because of this. This art movement is also characterized by use of light, as well as landscapes appearing as the main image (instead of as the background of an image). Artists also tended to go outside to paint or see their subjects, instead of keeping in their studios.\n\n== History ==\nWhile Impressionism did not explicitly begin until the 1870s, it has its roots in works and artists prior to this time. Henri Fantin-Latour\u2019s [[Realism|realist]] works occasionally reflected the experimental styles that characterized Impressionism. Johan Jongkind\u2019s and Eug\u00e8ne Boudin\u2019s interest in the portrayal and impact of light were similarly important. Edouard Manet also frequented Impressionist circles; both his techniques and subject matter influenced Impressionism. Manet is sometimes seen as the transition from [[Realism]] to Impressionism.\n\nThe first Impressionist exhibition was held in Paris in 1874, and featured Claude Monet, Edgar Degas, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Camille Pissarro, and Berthe Morisot, amongst many others. <ref>https://www.thoughtco.com/the-first-impressionist-exhibition-183013</ref> It was \u201cgreeted with taunts, skepticism . . . the word Impressionism was used by a hostile critic as a derisive term\u201d<ref>Moffett, Charles S. <em>Impressionist and Post-Impressionist Paintings in The Metropolitan Museum of Art</em>. pg. 7 ISBN 0-8109-1104-3.</ref>\n\n\n== Visual ==\nOne of the most important parts of Impressionism was the portrayal of light. This led to the \u201cdabbed\u201d brushwork that is so prominent, as it allowed artists to better portray light in their paintings. The brushwork also made the paintings appear unfinished, as if they were an \u201cimpression\u201d of a painting.\n\nColor also played an important role. Prior to Impressionism, painters frequently applied a varnish that toned down the colors of their works. Impressionist artists rejected this idea. Furthermore, developments in synthetic pigments allowed artists to use new, brighter colors that contrasted previous art styles.<ref>https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/imml/hd_imml.htm</ref>\n\n== Notable Artists ==\n* Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bazille\n* Eug\u00e8ne Boudin\n* Mary Stevenson Cassatt\n* Paul C\u00e9zanne\n* Edgar Degas\n* Paul Gauguin\n* Paul Guigou\n* Vincent Van Gogh\n* \u00c9douard Manet\n* Oscar-Claude Monet\n* Berthe Morisot\n* Camille Pissarro\n* Pierre-Auguste Renoir\n* Alfred Sisley\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery widths=\"185\">\nLadyWithUmbrella.jpg|Woman with a Parasol \u2013 Madame Monet and Her Son (Monet, 1875)\nClaudemonet.jpg\nEdgardegas.jpg\nRenoir.jpeg\nCassatt.jpg\nPuigaudeau.jpg\nDegas-singer-green-1884.jpg|The Singer in Green (Edgar Degas, 1884)\nManet-boating-1874.jpg|Boating (Edouard Manet, 1874)\nSisley-chestnut-1878.jpg|All\u00e9e of Chestnut Trees (Alfred Sisley, 1878)\nRenoir-arab-woman.jpg|Old Arab Woman (Pierre-Auguste Renoir, 1882)\nPissarro-lacroix-island.jpg|Lacroix Island at Rouen (Camille Pissarro, 1883)\n</gallery>\n\n== References ==\n* https://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/i/impressionism\n* http://www.visual-arts-cork.com/history-of-art/realism-to-impressionism.htm\n* Moffett, Charles S. <em>Impressionist and Post-Impressionist Paintings in The Metropolitan Museum of Art</em>.
