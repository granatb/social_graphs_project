In a post describing Steelpunk on the SFFWorld website it is characterised as being \"about\u00a0hardware, not\u00a0software, the\u00a0real world\u00a0not the\u00a0virtual world,\u00a0megatechology\u00a0not\u00a0nanotechnology. The artefacts of Steelpunk aren\u2019t grown, printed or programmed, they\u2019re built. With rivets.\" \n\nExamples given in the post include\u00a0Mad Max,\u00a0Terminator,\u00a0Barb Wire,\u00a0Iron Man\u00a0and\u00a0Snowpiercer. Other writers suggest Harry Harrison\u2019s\u00a0Stainless Steel Rat\u00a0series, the\u00a0Heinlein juveniles\u00a0and the film\u00a0Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow. <sub>[excerpt from [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberpunk_derivatives Wikipedia]]</sub>\n\n== Description ==\nIn the same [https://www.sffworld.com/forum/threads/is-steelpunk-the-new-steampunk-does-steelpunk-even-exist.55392/ SFFWorld post] as credited for the naming of steelpunk above, steelpunk is described as being \"as much about dirty dystopias as it is high-chrome dreams. Start with a nice disaster, add a bit of social disorder and our interconnected technological ecosystems grind to a halt. Time to dig out yesterday\u2019s machines. Ice Age coming? You need Snowpiercer\u2019s allegorical supertrain. Global crop blight? Try Interstellar\u2019s forgotten spaceship. The two main themes of Steelpunk that make it into the mainstream are Fight and Flight. Battlesuits, war machines and rampaging robots turn up again and again, as do flying cars and jetpacks... Steelpunk is all about physical power, and the gadgets and contraptions that deliver it. It\u2019s playing with fire and having fun while it\u2019s at it.\" Little other specific resources can be found about steelpunk on the web, making this a notably niche aesthetic.\n\n== Visual ==\n\nSteelpunk is seen by some as a uselessly pedantic or redundant aesthetic, and is often conflated with similar aesthetics like dieselpunk, steampunk, rocketpunk, or atompunk\u2014though its proposed alternative name, aluminumpunk, may provide clearer description for how the aesthetic varies visually from its counterparts. The aesthetic is mainly focused on the visual construction of how steel or aluminum-based elements are assembled, the revival of grand, power-focused machinery, and the speculative design of those elements.\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nFile:Steelpunk2.jpg\nFile:Steelpunk-edgeoftomorrow.jpg\nFile:Steelpunk3.jpg\nFile:Steelpunk4.jpg\nFile:Steelpunk-madmax.jpg\nFile:Steelpunk-irongiant.png\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Written]]\n[[Category:Punk Suffix]]\n[[Category:Needs work]]\n[[Category:Fashion]]\n[[Category:Candidates for Deletion]]"}}}]}}}}
