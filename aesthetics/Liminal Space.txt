Typically these are abandoned, and oftentimes empty - a mall at 4am or a school hallway during summer, for example. This makes it feel frozen and slightly unsettling, but also familiar to our minds.\n\nWARNING: Might cause derealization and depression.<br />\n\n== History ==\n''This section is under construction''\n\nOn May 12, 2019, an anonymous 4chan users asked on the /x/ paranormal board \"post disquieting images that just feel 'off'\" \n<br />\n==Concept==\nTrue to its etymology (\"limina the Latin word ''limen'', meaning \"threshold\"), the concept of a liminal space classically encompasses physical spaces that, due to their function, are transitional - hallways, waiting rooms, parking lots and rest stops are the archetypical examples of such places. Liminal space aesthetics relate to the unique and combined feeling of eeriness, nostalgia, and apprehension one gets when presented with such places outside of their designed context. Most notably, their function as intermediary points between origin and destination. For instance, an empty stairwell or hospital corridor at night might appear as sinister or uncanny because these places are usually brimming with life and movement. Therefore, the absence of external stimuli (such as conversations, people moving around, or any kind of dynamism) creates an otherworldly and forlorn atmosphere.\n\nWhile this definition is the closest to the usual, academic meaning of liminality, it should be noted that liminal space aesthetics have recently expanded in scope to include images of places that are simply nostalgic, dreamlike, and/or uncanny, to the point where the only remaining common trait across these ramifications is the striking absence of people. Although these are an incorporated part of the liminal space ''aesthetic'', they are not considered as liminal spaces ''themselves''. While this diversity waters down the definition of a \"liminal space\" by quite a lot, it also explains the memetic status of physical liminality by linking its mysterious allure to the childhood memories and aesthetics of its fans, usually by invoking the cultural memory of the Millenial/Z generations. At this point, the strong link between liminal spaces and [[Traumacore]], [[Hauntology]], or other related aesthetics becomes apparent.\n\nLiminal space aesthetics also have a significant overlap with those of [[After Hours]], since both explore the atmosphere of vacant spaces - which are easier to find during night time. But while the After Hours aesthetic plays with feelings of peacefulness and a tranquil mindset, liminal spaces have a more unsettling appeal. \n\nLiminal spaces are also quite subjective. What appears nostalgic to one person may be more unsettling to another, while some may find the same image bland with no emotions attached to it. There is even debate as to whether it should even be considered an ''aesthetic''. \n\n==Visual==\nLiminal space aesthetics consists of any room, corridor, or hallway that is big and empty, yet carries an eerie and unsettling vibe with it (this part is key in separating the Liminal Space aesthetic from just a regular photo of an empty room/corridor/hallway). This effect can be achieved with photo edits ([[Vaporwave]], [[Acidwave]], and [[Glitch]], in particular, can assist in this effect. Although applying these can sometimes ruin the liminality of the image), simple lighting tricks, or just capturing the mood at the right time of day.\n\nSome edits of liminal spaces can give the effect of being in a retro horror or RPG video game (as popularized by YouTuber/Instagramer YOURLOCALBREADMAN) which can tap into either the uncomfortable, the surreal, or could just go full-on Lovecraftian with some of the design choices made in these style of video edits. Empty game servers and maps, mainly those presenting old-fashioned graphics like GMod, No Players Online, Team Fortress, and early CoD instalments, have also been described as liminal.\n\n=== The Backrooms ===\nDespite this, however, possibly the best-known example of a liminal space is [https://backrooms.fandom.com/wiki/Backrooms_Wiki The Backrooms]; an entry into the pantheon of creepypasta that is described as \"what you see when you no-clip out of reality\" The Backrooms has been adapted into a variety of media, but has been a particularly popular topic in the realm of video games, where no less than 5 games are based on the concept. In videos on YouTube discussing liminal spaces, The Backrooms are a popular point of reference to use when describing the aesthetic as a whole.\n\n==Resources==\nExternal links to help get a better understanding of this aesthetic.\n\n===Wikipedia===\n\n*[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liminality Liminality]\n*[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Liminal_spaces Wikimedia category page for free-use pictures of liminal spaces]\n\n===Playlists===\n\n* [https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4qnEvGmZdZOgJ2zLI77KnI?si=92a0bcc6e1144145 \u26a1AESTHETIC: liminal space]  by Chaotic Good\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6dMV1AKGlkRLm7uKohg2tD?si=8MphE5KKTIGoX3xnY5nS_Q&dl_branch=1 trapped in a traumatic parallel dimension all alone] by Haneli\u2661\n\n===Pinterest Boards===\n\n*[https://www.pinterest.com/nataliejulow/liminal-spaces Liminal spaces by Rintindin]\n*[https://www.pinterest.com/not_oscar_wilde/aes-liminal-spaces aes: liminal spaces by not oscar wilde]\n*[https://www.pinterest.com/captainfqbulous/liminal-spaces liminal spaces by cherie]\n*[https://www.pinterest.com/celinaslattery/liminal-space/ Liminal Space by Celina Slattery]\n\n===Videos===\n\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N63pQGhvK4M Liminal Spaces (Exploring an Altered Reality)]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uv9BbkSMSi8&t Explaining Liminal Spaces]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yeza4QZkyVw&t What is Liminal Space?]\n\n===Other Media===\n\n*[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYQuC-1tppYBisNzHRE3Wyw YOURLOCALBREADMAN]\n*The Backrooms\n*[https://www.reddit.com/r/LiminalSpace/ r/LiminalSpace], [https://www.reddit.com/r/LiminalReality/ r/LiminalReality], [https://www.reddit.com/r/liminalspacesgaming/ r/liminalspacesgaming]\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" orientation=\"none\" widths=\"130\" columns=\"dynamic\">\nEerie photos of abandoned malls, big-box and chain stores.png|mall\nTop Secret Research Facility II by svalbard-in-winter on DeviantArt.jpg|hotel\nHOTTIE.png\n\u0424\u043e\u0442\u043e \u0437\u0430\u0431\u0440\u043e\u0448\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u043c\u0430\u0433\u0430\u0437\u0438\u043d\u044b \u0438 \u0442\u043e\u0440\u0433\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0435 \u0446\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0440\u044b \u0418\u0437\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u2116 17 .jpg\nAssignment one the interaction of media.jpg\nLs3.PNG\nKlaus.Mp3\nBackrooms.PNG.png\nScreenshot 2021-01-23 at 5.24.55 PM.png\nOx7uv10mv2g61.jpg\n555555555555555555555566666664444444444.jpg\nDpc1.png\nDpc2.jpg\nDpc3.jpg\nDpc4.jpg\nDpc5.png\nDpc6.jpg\nAirport-terminal-liminal.jpg\nCentre-ville-malle.jpg\n63024568.jpg\nEmpty-bookstore.jpg\nEmpty-sears-ok.jpg\nMytraumacore.jpg\nLiminal.jpeg\nLiminal1.jpeg\nLiminal2.jpeg\nLiminal3.jpeg\nLiminal4.jpeg\nLiminal5.webp\n8C196548-B8F0-42C1-B394-DD4301E286BA.jpeg\n99C7189F-7A07-4E56-8C31-E4BB18569D7A.jpeg\nAFF2A23F-E9FC-4E11-8454-E7F2F06BB562.png|A 3d rendered liminal space\nEAFC9B91-4979-4919-8252-8C28BBED4838.png\nUntitled-23.jpg\n0BB9E8F9-44F6-43C8-9CF0-593EFC564C9F.jpeg\nB48EEA94-4C0E-4CA6-B2C3-E37C092E7C3D.jpeg\n68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f31375a47493638564e4752486e413d3d2d3931323832313631392e313631643635396364386137323561323435343433.jpg\nTumblr 6682dd685c19c4ec1ea530d4550d214c b4180cea 2048.jpg\nTumblr 9172598566cab507120a8341607c5e0f 869601be 500.jpg\nTumblr e3691c73af29370b3057fbb6ec896ba1 c859c0b0 1280.jpg\nTumblr 6d46e18de8d611952c7e1c790c26d29b 4e344050 1280.jpg\nTumblr 9d37e22c34b4488be50a0639c0ad6dc4 0ae240d2 1280.jpg\nTumblr ee3b82e93907968c4e75aa3ce5c36e44 d93897b4 1280.jpg\nF84DA9F6-F6F3-4B02-8320-A6B54AB84549.jpeg\nBA72FC53-BE86-46C1-9538-30085B7ED785.jpeg\nCar park.jpg\n49a49312e3669318df916d3f2858546d.png\nEmpty malls.jpg\nOIP (15).jpg\n6667799bec3a847840102f745f83323a.jpg\nFile:Aptliminal2007.png\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Visual]]\n[[Category:Creepy]]"}}}]}}}}
