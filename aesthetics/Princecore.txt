Princecore is heavily based on gay relationships. Most of its popularity is on Tumblr. A majority of Princecore writing is heavily centered around fictional gay prompts centering relationships between princes and knights, or other princes. Though less common, fictional relationships between princes and female knights also make up a part of the Princecore aesthetic. There are generally two sides of Princecore, one being elegant and mature, the other slightly more childish and young with fantastical aspects. \n\n==Visual==\nVisuals are shared with other Royalcore genres like Princesscore and [[Queencore]] in that castles, crowns, and ornate gardens are present. Princecore may rely more on paper and quills or pens to suggest poem writing to lovers and may be softer than [[Kingcore]]. Examples are listed in the gallery.\n\n=== Fashion ===\nFashion includes:\n\n* Suits\n* Jackets\n* Button-ups/collared shirts\n* Dressy pants\n* Riding boots\n* Polished shoes\n*Crowns\n*Male jewelry\n*Cloaks/Capes\n*Surcoat\n*Tunic\n*Poet Shirts\n*Oxford shoes\n\n== Media ==\n\n=== Stage Shows ===\n\n* Goodtime Charlie (musical) by Sidney Michaels\n* Pericles, Prince of Tyre- play by George Wilkins and William Shakespeare\n\nTV Shows\n\n* Merlin (2008-2012)\n*Young Royals (2021-)\n\nMovies\n\n* The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian (2008)\n* Pippin (1981)\n* The Prince and The Pauper (1973)\n* Hamlet (1996)\n*Coming to America (1988)\n*Adventures of Prince Achmed (1926)\n*Alexander Nevsky (1938)\n*The Iron Crown/La Corona Del Ferro (1954)\n*Krull (1983)\n*Prince Valiant (1954)\n*The Dark Avenger (1955)\n\nBooks\n\n* The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian by C.S.
