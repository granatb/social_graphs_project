The term derived from the unrelated \"French New Wave\" and was originally used as a catch-all for the music that emerged after\u00a0[[Punk]] [[Rock]], including punk itself, but may be viewed retrospectively as a less challenging counterpart of\u00a0[[Post-Punk]]. \n\nAlthough new wave shared punk's\u00a0DIY-philosophy, the artists were more influenced by the lighter strains of 1960s pop while opposed to mainstream\u00a0\"[[Corporate]]\" rock, which they considered creatively stagnant, and the generally abrasive and political bents of punk rock. Common characteristics of new wave music include the use of synthesizers and electronic productions, and a distinctive visual style featured in music videos and fashion.\n\n==Subgenres==\n===Coldwave===\n''Under Construction.''\n===Chillwave===\n''Under Construction.''\n===Darkwave===\n''Under Construction.''\n===Etherealwave===\n''Under Construction.''\n===Minimalwave===\n''Under Construction.''\n===Synthwave===\n''See [[Synthwave]] for more information.''\n===Vaporwave===\n''See [[Vaporwave]] for more information.''\n\n[[Category:Wave Suffix]]\n[[Category:Music]]\n[[Category:Needs work]]\n[[Category:Written]]\n[[Category:Candidates for Deletion]]\n[[Category:Needs images]]"}}}]}}}}
