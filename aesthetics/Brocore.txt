Although the popular image of bro lifestyle is associated with sports apparel and fraternities, it lacks a consistent definition.\n\n== Philosophy ==\nMost aspects of Brocore can vary regionally, it can blend in with the Surfer culture of California, the [[Americana|Redneck]] culture of the Southeast, the [[Preppy]] culture of New England, the [[Chav]] culture of England, et cetera. Brocore guys may often be seen around some [[Baddie]]s or older members of Brocore may find themselves with a [[Karencore|Karen]] on their hands.\n\n== Visual ==\nBrocore visuals feature things that will typically get the adrenaline pumping and the testosterone flowing; fast and/or loud cars, [[Athlete|sports]], guys getting drunk, [[Stripcore|ogling beautiful women]], and [[Scrapper|occasionally getting into fights in an attempt to establish the bro-hierarchy in a particular troop of Bros]].  When the Bro is pacified, he can be generally be well-meaning and laid-back, but if the Bro is angered (or incredibly drunk) it might be best to stay away from the Bro at all costs.\n\n== Fashion ==\nBrocore fashion features cargo shorts or pants, jean shorts (or \"jorts\"), sportswear, camouflage patterns, baseball caps, and t-shirts or hoodies emblazoned with the Monster Energy Drink logo. Brocore's fashion is generally similar to [[Normcore]] (although Normcore is going for a completely different vibe).  But while the Bro generally just wants to hang out, have a few drinks, and watch the game, some Bros have a tendency to get super aggressive at the drop of a hat. Brocore fashion includes:\n\n* Frayed-brim\u00a0baseball hats\n* Oxford shirts\n* Sports team T-shirts\n* Cargo shorts\n* Basketball shorts\n* Muscle Tees\n* Boat shoes\u00a0or\u00a0sandals\n* Snapbacks, trucker hats\n* Wrist sweatbands\n* Mullets, pompadours, fades\n* Vans, Timberlands, Nikes\n* Brocore bands hoodies\u00a0and t-shirts\n* \u201cvintage\u201d style t-shirts of bands from the 70s, they never listened to and know little about.\n* Shirts that wouldn't look out of place in the [[Bastardcore]] aesthetic\n\nUnlike many aesthetics, Brocore's color palette is not restricted; it can extend throughout the entire color spectrum.<br />\n\n== Music ==\n* O.A.R.\n* Dispatch\n* Dave Matthews\u00a0Band\n* Rage Against The Machine\n* Juice WRLD\n* Post Malone\n* Trapt\n* Kid Rock\n* Avenged Sevenfold\n* Florida Georgia Line\n* Pantera\n* Nickelback\n* Shinedown\n* Limp Bizkit\n* Theory of a Deadman\n* Five Finger Death Punch\n* Staind\n* Linkin Park\n* Luke Bryan\n* Hinder\n* Creed\n* Buckcherry\n* Papa Roach\n* Breaking Benjamin\n* Seether\n* 12 Stones\n* Saliva\n* Drowning Pool\n* Puddle of Mudd\n* Three Days Grace\n* Skillet\n* Evanescence\n\n== Activities ==\n* Drinking more Monster Energy than is probably considered safe by the FDA\n* Chugging alcohol\n* Punching walls\n* Getting married to a [[Karencore|Karen]]\n* Pulling insane stunts to try and impress people\n* Going to the gym and working on trying to get \"swole\" (even though they may not have the genetics for it)\n* Generally going through life with a overly carefree attitude (sometimes it can be taken to an extreme that can come off as inconsiderate of others)\n\n== Origins of the \"Kyle\" archetype ==\nAccording to Know Your Meme, the earliest documented proof of a Kyle is Nick Colleti's \"White Kid Fight\" Vine. On April 18th, 2019, Twitter user @vinnybrack posted a \"Nobody:\" joke about \"kids named Kyle\", showing a shirtless white boy with a collection of Monster Energy drinks and a hole punched into drywall. The tweet amassed over 29,000 retweets and 128,000 likes, and on May 27th, 2019, YouTuber Trevor Wallace posted a video in which he performed the exaggerated \"Kyle\" character, gaining over a million views.\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery widths=\"130\">\n\nAsher Roth - I Love College (Dirty Video)|The ultimate Brocore anthem.\nBro-classic.jpeg\nBro-indie.jpg\nBro-norm.jpg\nBro-swim.png\nBro-concert.jpg\nBro-party.jpg\nBro-corporate-wolf-wallstreet.jpg\nFile:Baptism.jpg|Baptism by Bro\n\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Core Suffix]]\n[[Category:Visual]]\n[[Category:Fashion]]\n[[Category:Music]]\n[[Category:Masculine]]\n[[Category:Mainstream]]\n[[Category:Stereotypes]]"}}}]}}}}
