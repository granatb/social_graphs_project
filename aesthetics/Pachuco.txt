Pachucos were targeted and faced xenophobic and racist hate crimes in the United States because they were easily recognized by their clothing. Also, the Pachuco and Pachuca identities were closely tied with Chicano right's movements. Therefore, if any non-Chicanos adopt this identify as an aesthetic, it will be cultural appropriation. Please be respectful of Chicano/Mexican-American culture, and feel free to discuss.''\n\n'''Pachuco''' refers to a subculture of Chicanos and Mexican-Americans, associated with zoot suits, street gangs, nightlife, and flamboyant public behavior.\u00a0\n\n'''Pachuca'''\u00a0is the female counterpart, often idealized as a beautiful Chicana woman in extravagant evening dress or a female version of the zoot suit, out with a pachuco boyfriend for a night on the town. Pachucas broke\u00a0taboos\u00a0of their time by wearing men's-style pants sometimes and appearing in public often with their pachuco boyfriends; at the time, a \"good woman\" was considered to have her place in the home.\n\n== Style ==\nPachucos became known for their distinguished look, dialogue, and actions. Pachucos dressed in recognizable\u00a0Zoot suits, and often styled their hair into ducktails. Things like decorative chains and tattoos were also sometimes part of the pachuco look.
