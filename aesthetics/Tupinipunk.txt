It was originally coined in the 2000s, to describe a satirical genre that criticized the predominant US-centric and Eurocentric views of the sci-fi genre. It encompasses various different views, criticisms and references, as Brazil is a vast and populated country, and its regions vary greatly from each other in traditions, local cultures, regional lingos and history.  Although the movement has known origins since the 30s, with the novel ''O Colecionador de M\u00e3os (The Hand Collector)'', by Jeronymo Monteiro, and having multiple representatives through the 20th century, it was mostly considered a ''cult'' and underground genre, until its surge in popularity thanks to the widespread reach of information of the internet in the 2000s and 2010s.\n\n== Visual ==\n''Neon lights, tiki bars''\n\n== Fashion ==\n''Under Construction''\n\n== Written ==\n''Under Construction''\n\n== Music ==\n''Under Construction''\n\n== Gallery ==\n''Under Construction''\n[[Category:Punk Suffix]]\n[[Category:Brazilian]]\n[[Category:Needs work]]\n[[Category:Visual]]\n[[Category:Fashion]]\n[[Category:Written]]\n[[Category:Music]]"}}}]}}}}
