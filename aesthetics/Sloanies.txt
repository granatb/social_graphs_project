Sometimes these people are referred to as \"Posh\" but it is important to note that not all posh people are Sloanes. Probably, the most famous example of this subculture was Diana Spencer, before and around the time she married Prince Charles. Another notable example is the TV character\u00a0Tim Nice-But-Dim, an\u00a0Old Ardinian.\n\nThe term is a humorous combination of \"Sloane Square\", a location in\u00a0Chelsea, London, famed for the wealth of residents and frequenters, and the television character\u00a0''The Lone Ranger''.<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sloane_Ranger</ref>\n\n== History ==\nThe Sloane Ranger has roots in the English upper classes. Families were peers of the Realm (members of the Royal Family or those with titles presented by the Royal Family) or landed gentry (people who controlled estates and received income from tenants renting land on the estate). Men in these families were members of the House of Lords, who had huge influence on British government and society.\n\nDuring the British colonial era, British aristocrats settled in Australia, Canada, India and the United States. In the United States, they formed the WASP and [[Preppy]] subcultures, which can be very similar to the Sloane Ranger aesthetic.\n\nIn the 1920s, many of the old estates fell into disrepair due to rising costs and the decline of the servant class. Today many old estates are museums and historical sites. Other estates which remain in the family are rented out for movie and television productions, such as Highclare Castle, the setting for Downton Abbey. Despite the \"poverty\" of the aristocracy (relative to their ancestors), an old family name or title gives a Sloane status.\n\nPart of the Sloane Ranger aesthetic is a sense of nostalgia for the past, whether it be the 18th century, or the 1920s-1950s. The nostalgia tends to be very patriotic, romanticizing British history and historical figures such as Winston Churchill and members of the Royal Family and ignoring the dark side of British imperialism.\n\n== Values ==\nMost of the things that Sloanes value are very old. They do not like or trust things which are new, foreign, or French.\n\n* English Patriotism, including extreme loyalty to the Queen and the Royal Family\n* \"Good Schools\" - Eton, Harrow, Oxford, Cambridge\n* noble titles\n* pedigree dogs\n* pedigree horses\n* Georgian era antique furniture \n* jewelry and silver passed down from family members<br />\n\n== Visuals ==\nPlaces and things associated with the English upper classes. There is some crossover with [[Dark Academia|Dark]] and [[Light Academia]] aesthetics because many Sloanes attend boarding school and later prestigious universities such as Cambridge, Oxford, and St. Andrews.\n\n* A country house or estate\n* British patriotic imagery such as the Union Flag and images of the Queen\n* English village life\n* Horses and equestrian imagery\n* Many dogs, especially hunting breeds like labradors, Jack Russells, King Charleses, Irish Setters\n* Oil paintings of ancestors\n* Scottish tartans and similar plaids\n*The Cotswolds\n*chickens\n\n==Fashion==\nClothing is generally modest and long lasting. Royal Warrants can be issued to brands which produce high quality goods favored by the Queen, the Duke of Edinburgh, and the Prince of Wales. Warrants can be revoked if the actions of the company displeases the person who issued it. Rigby & Peller, which provided the Queen's undergarments, had its warrant revoked in 2018.\n\nNatural fibers like cotton, wool, and silk are favored. The English insistence on maintaining their traditional dress codes, despite being impractical for the climate of India or the Caribbean, is often mocked in fiction.\n\n*Blazers in red and navy blue\n*Aran aka Fisherman sweaters\n*Faire Isle sweaters\n*Cardigans\n*Kilts (men) or pleated skirts (women) in the family tartan\n*Liberty print shirts and dresses\n*Wax jackets (especially ones from Barbour)\n*Pashmina\n*Pearl necklaces and earrings\n*Polo shirts\n*Remembrance Poppy (poppy shaped pin worn in November to commemorate veterans of the British Armed Forces)\n*Riding boots\n*Rain boots aka wellies\n*Silk dressing gown\n* Skinny jeans\n*Tennis whites and cricket whites (white sweater and pants or skirt)\n*Tweed suit and flat cap for hunting (men)\n\n=== Makeup ===\nMakeup is generally natural, with products used to enhance features. The Sloane Ranger handbook describes the look as \"fresh scrubbed.\"\n\n* Essie Ballet Slipper nail polish - worn by Queen Elizabeth\n* Elizabeth Arden lipstick - worn by Queen Elizabeth\n* Trilogy Rose Hip Oil - used by Kate Middleton\n* Kiehl's Creme with Silk Groom - used by Kate Middleton\n* Charlotte Tilbury Full Fat Lashes Mascara - used by Princess Eugenie\n\n=== Brands ===\nMembers of the Royal Family are loyal to certain brands. Fashion blogs and magazines report on the styles worn by Kate Middleton and Meghan Markle, which have made them popular among the general public. Website crashes due to sudden interest in items are common.\n\n* Burberry\n* Barbour\n*Fairfax & Favor\n*Gianvito Rossi\n*Gieves & Hawkes\n* Hunter\n*Jimmy Choo\n* Laura Ashley\n*L.K.
