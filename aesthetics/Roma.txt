In certain communities, mysticism and religion hold an important place.\n\n\n\nRomani/Romany, are an Indo-Aryan ethnic group mostly living in Europe, but can be found all over the world. Traditionally the group was nomadic, but permanent living has become more common (although it depends on the country they are living in). Roma generally place a high value on the extended family and tend to live and marry with other Roma. There is a distinct way of living, ''Romanipen'' (also ''romanypen'', ''romanipe'', ''romanype'', ''romanimos'', ''romaimos'', ''romaniya'') that encompasses traditions, laws, philosophies etc. However the concept is interpreted differently depending on the Romani group and what country they live in.\n\nThe Roma people have a rich culture and have faced racism and discrimination, even to this day. One example is the word gypsy, which is a derogatory term that many ''gadjo'' (masculine)/''gadji'' (feminine) (non-Romani, in Angloromani: gorja ) use without knowing it is harmful. Be careful if using anything related to Roma in your aesthetics since it's easy to fall into cultural appropriation.\n== Visual ==\n* Forests\n* Villages\n*Trailers\n*Campfire\n*Foxes, hedgehogs, horses and dogs\n*Owl, crows and ravens\n* Patchwork\n*Flowers\n*Tattoos\n\n==Fashion==\nRoma fashion is made of strong and/or inexpensive fabrics, from salvaged clothes with various colours and patterns (such as plaid, stripes, baroque patterns and flowers), associated with a facultive abundance of accessories.You can find all of this in thrift stores, second hand shops etc ... \n\n===Tops===\n\n==== Shirts :====\n\n*Classic collar shirts\n* Mandarin collar shirts\n*Henley shirts\n*Tank tops\n\n====Other :====\n\n*Blazers\n*Waistcoasts\n*Plaid dresses\n*Patchwork dresses\n*Sweaters\n*Overcoats\n*Trench coats\n\n===Bottoms===\n\n*Ankle pants\n*Trousers\n*Overalls\n*Skirts\n\n===Shoes===\n\n*Leather boots\n*Ankle boots\n*Heeled ankle boots\n*Brogues\n\n===Accessories===\n\n*Jewelry\n* Ties and Bow ties\n*Pocket watches\n*Scarves and tissue handkerchiefs\n* Hats and newsboy cap\n*Gloves\n\n== Activities ==\n\n* Sleeping in the forest\n* Campfire\n* Read the future in the cards and the lines of the hand\n* Playing guitar or violin (more particularly gypsy jazz)\n\n==Arts and entertainment==\n\n=== Music ===\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Django_Reinhardt Django Rheinhardt] \n\n<br />\n\n=== Cinema and TV ===\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Django_(2017_film) Django (2017)]\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherlock_Holmes:_A_Game_of_Shadows Sherlock Holmes A Game of shadows (2011)]\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chocolat_(2000_film) Chocolat (2000)]\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peaky_Blinders Peaky Blinders (2013)]\n\n<br />\n\n=== Literature ===\n''Under Construction''\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" widths=\"110\" orientation=\"landscape\" navigation=\"true\">\n\nFile:Sh22-1024x681.jpg\nFile:Maxresdefaults.jpg\nFile:RD BW 5.jpg\nFile:Cin\u00e9ma Musique contre horreurs nazies dans le film Django .jpg\nFile:D08a0c26c88305de40f68beff7151e9e.jpg\nFile:3503550 French Gypsy.jpg\nFile:88c4d4797946614b6666dcde767fe624--gypsy-men-gypsy-life.jpg\nFile:Antheus007 Photo.png\nFile:Rare photo of DJANGO REINHARDT .jpg\nFile:Ralph Lauren is Bringing Western Workwear Back\u2014Again.jpg\nFile:Pin by ronnie on Stile vintage Vintage mens fashion, Suspenders men, Mens fashion casual.jpg\nFile:T\u00e9l\u00e9charger.jpg\nFile:T\u00e9l\u00e9charger (1).jpg\n\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Music]]\n[[Category:Needs work]]\n[[Category:Fashion]]\n[[Category:Visual]]"}}}]}}}}
