It also involves hiking as well. Hikecore relies on appreciation for nature and hiking. Those who belong to the hikecore aesthetic are generally accepting of all things natural and encourage a healthy relationship with the world around them. They enjoy casual/practical clothing with a whimsical outdoorsy touch. This is very similar to adventurecore, but hikecore takes place in purely forests and campgrounds. Adventurecore can take place in jungles and various other places. '''Hikecore can be considered to be a type of adventurecore, but they are not the same.'''\n\n==Visual==\nHikecore visuals often portray mountains and other outdoor areas. Imagery of long hiking trails and large grassy meadows is not uncommon, as well as visuals of the sky and clouds. Images of animals that one might come across whilst hiking, such as birds, deer, squirrels, and foxes. \n\n==Fashion==\nHikecore fashion consists of mostly, if not entirely, hiking gear. Stuff like hiking boots, practical clothing, coats, multiple layers, and accessories such as backpacks, bags, compass, knives, and hiking sticks. Colors include earthy tones, such as brown, beige, black, greys, dark greens, greens, navies, and greys.\n\nIt is important to keep the natural, simple feel to clothing, but to embrace that humans are a part of nature.\n\n==Activities==\n\n*Hiking\n*Exploring\n*Rock-Climbing\n*Gathering trinkets and cool rocks\n*Sitting around a campfire\n*Photography\n*Illustrations and Drawings\n*Animal Tracking\n* Kayaking/Canoeing\n\n====Where to find it:====\n\n*[https://www.decathlon.co.uk/browse/c0-sports/c1-hiking/c2-hiking-gear-and-equipment/_/N-5oxkd6 Decathlon]\n*[https://www.mountainwarehouse.com/outdoor/outdoor-equipment/ Mountain Warehouse]\n*[https://www.trespass.com/walking Trespass]\n*[https://www.alpinetrek.co.uk/walking/ Alpine Trek]\n\n==Music==\n\n=== Playlists===\n\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/31FCpTOALGXlD3TIOjba9N?si=2f9ee180dacf449b hikecore by Justin Demanche]\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" widths=\"130\">\nTumblr ff7e006a297965af9e48a2c39b51897b 9731fdca 640.jpg|Hikecore often involves boots or clothing fit for hiking or camping\nTumblr 33e250759348c11ba51cafea1cdd08e9 79f052df 640.jpg|Appreciation of natural beauty\nR509eb7047ef9cf637d7e3fba3005b0da.jpg\nFile:Adventure-1867379 1920.jpg\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Visual]]\n[[Category:Core Suffix]]\n[[Category:Needs work]]\n[[Category:Fields and forests]]\n[[Category:Candidates for Deletion]]"}}}]}}}}
