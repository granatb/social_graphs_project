This is considered to be the \"foundation of the energy body\", from which the other chakras are opened afterward. It is associated with survival instincts and the excretion of bodily wastes (hence its connection to the anus).\u00a0Its corresponding element is \"earth\" and its corresponding sense is smell.\n*'''Svadhisthana:''' The orange chakra.\u00a0It is referred to as the \"sacral chakra\" and is believed to exist and the base of one's genitals.\u00a0Associated with this chakra are pleasure, sense of self, sensuality, passion, procreation, and the ability to have relationships (even non-sexual ones).\u00a0Its corresponding element is \"water\" and its corresponding sense is taste.\n*'''Manipura:''' The yellow chakra.\u00a0It is often referred to as the \"Solar Plexus chakra\" due to its location at one's solar plexus and is believed to govern the digestive and endocrine systems.\u00a0Associated with this chakra are energy, willpower, digestion, metabolism, transformation, and achievement.\u00a0Its corresponding element is \"fire\" and its corresponding sense is sight.\n*'''Anahata:''' The green chakra.\u00a0It is often referred to as the \"Heart chakra\" due to its location at one's heart and is believed to govern decision-making, love, charity, psychic healing, and compassion.\u00a0Its corresponding element is \"sound\" and its corresponding sense is touch.\n*'''Vishuddha:''' The blue chakra.\u00a0It is often referred to as the \"Throat chakra\" due to its location in the throat and is believed to govern creativity, self-expression, and learning potential.\u00a0Its corresponding element is \"aether\" and its corresponding sense is hearing.\n*'''Ajna:''' The indigo chakra.\u00a0It is often referred to as the \"Third Eye chakra\" due to its location in the middle of one's forehead (almost like a third eye) and is believed to be linked to the pineal gland and governs the brain.\u00a0Associated with this chakra are intuition, intellect, the subconscious mind, the ability to receive messages from the past, or the future, and the ability to communicate to the world.\u00a0It has no corresponding element and its corresponding sense is sleep.\n*'''Sahasrara:''' The violet chakra.\u00a0It is often referred to as the \"Crown chakra\", but does not have a location in the physical body, instead of residing over the person and is believed to be associated with pure consciousness.\u00a0Once this chakra has been unlocked, it is believed that a person has finally attained [[Grunge|nirvana]].\n\n==Zodiac==\nThe Zodiac relates to the star signs of the same name. There are many times of Zodiac systems dating back to many ancient cultures, but the 2 most popular ones are the Western Zodiac (determined by the time of year you were born in), followed by the Chinese Zodiac (determined by the actual year you were born in), like one could be a Virgo born year of the Rat, a Scorpio born year of the Dragon, a \"Double Ox\" (Taurus born year of the Ox), or a \"Double Cat\" (a Leo born year of the Tiger).\n\nFor those of you who are curious about what the zodiac signs are, here's a breakdown of them:\n\n===Western Zodiac ===\nThe Western Zodiac is broken down based on the particular time of year one is born in, which goes as follows:\n\n*Aries (March 21 \u2013 April 19)\n*Taurus (April 20 \u2013 May 20)\n* Gemini (May 21 \u2013 June 20)\n*Cancer (June 21 \u2013 July 22)\n*Leo (July 23 \u2013 August 22)\n*Virgo (August 23 \u2013 September 22)\n*Libra (September 23 \u2013 October 22)\n*Scorpio (October 23 \u2013 November 21)\n* Sagittarius (November 22 \u2013 December 21)\n*Capricorn (December 22 \u2013 January 19)\n* Aquarius (January 20 \u2013 February 18)\n* Pisces (February 19 \u2013 March 20)\n\nFurthermore, the Western Zodiac signs are broken down into the four traditional elements:\n\n*Fire (Aries, Leo, & Sagittarius)\n* Earth (Capricorn, Taurus, & Virgo)\n*Air (Libra, Aquarius, & Gemini) ''note: kinda funny Aquarius is an air sign and not a water sign''\n*Water (Cancer, Scorpio, & Pisces)\n\nThe Western Zodiac aesthetics (yes, this could be considered a sort of aesthetic umbrella, but probably not enough to be able to create their pages like with some other aesthetic subgenres) tie directly into one's astrological sign and might incorporate the element their respective sign falls under.\n=== Chinese Zodiac===\nThe Chinese Zodiac, unlike the Western Zodiac, is determined heavily by what year you were born, but it always runs in a cycle, which the order is as follows)\n\n*Rat (1900, 1912, 1924, 1936, 1948, 1960, 1972, 1984, 1996, 2008, 2020, 2032)\n*Ox (1901, 1913, 1925, 1937, 1949, 1961, 1973, 1985, 1997, 2009, 2021, 2033)\n*Tiger (1902, 1914, 1926, 1938, 1950, 1962, 1974, 1986, 1998, 2010, 2022, 2034)\n*Rabbit (1903, 1915, 1927, 1939, 1951, 1963, 1975, 1987, 1999, 2011, 2023, 2035)\n*Dragon (1904, 1916, 1928, 1940, 1952, 1964, 1976, 1988, 2000, 2012, 2024, 2036)\n*Snake (1905, 1917, 1929, 1941, 1953, 1965, 1977, 1989, 2001, 2013, 2025, 2037)\n*Horse (1906, 1918, 1930, 1942, 1954, 1966, 1978, 1990, 2002, 2014, 2026, 2038)\n*Sheep (1907, 1919, 1931, 1943, 1955, 1967, 1979, 1991, 2003, 2015, 2027, 2039)\n*Monkey (1908, 1920, 1932, 1944, 1956, 1968, 1980, 1992, 2004, 2016, 2028, 2040)\n*Rooster (1909, 1921, 1933, 1945, 1957, 1969, 1981, 1993, 2005, 2017, 2029, 2041)\n*Dog (1910, 1922, 1934, 1946, 1958, 1970, 1982, 1994, 2006, 2018, 2030, 2042)\n*Pig (1911, 1923, 1935, 1947, 1959, 1971, 1983, 1995, 2007, 2019, 2031, 2043)\n\nMuch like the Western Zodiac, the Chinese Zodiac also has their signs corresponding with the elements, though in this case, it has to do with the 5 Chinese Elements:\n\n*Wood (Tiger & Rabbit)\n**Wood symbolizes high morals, self-confidence, cooperation, idealism, and a variety of interests. The season associated with wood signs is Spring and the associated direction is the East.\n*Fire (Snake & Horse)\n** Fire symbolizes leadership, passion, decisiveness, self-confidence, positivity, and assertiveness. The season associated with fire signs is Summer and the associated direction is the South.\n*Earth (Ox, Dragon, Goat, & Dog)\n** Earth symbolizes seriousness, logic, methodicalness, intelligence, objectivity, and great planning skills. The season associated with Earth signs is the changing between seasons and the associated direction is Center.\n* Metal (Monkey & Rooster)\n**Metal symbolizes sincerity, fixed values & opinions, strong willpower, and eloquence. The season associated with Metal signs is Autumn and the associated direction is West.\n\n*water (Rat & Pig)\n**Water symbolizes persuasiveness, intuition, empathy, and objectivity (to the point they are often sought out for counsel in Ancient China). The season associated with Earth is Winter and the associated direction is North.\n\nBreaking it down even further, the signs can also fall into one of two categories; Yin or Yang.\n\n* Yin (Ox, Rabbit, Snake, Goat, Rooster, & Pig)\n* Yang (Rat, Tiger, Dragon, Horse, Monkey, & Dog)\n\nThe Yin and Yang represent the duality of humanity, with the Yin representing the feminine, darkness, and passiveness while the yang represents the masculine, light, and activeness.\n==Fashion==\nA lot of New Age fashion tends to include a lot of Yoga pants, tye dye clothing, and clothing that can tie in to the [[Hippie]] or [[Witchcore]] aesthetics.\n\n==Music==\nNew-age music includes both\u00a0acoustic\u00a0forms, featuring instruments such as\u00a0flutes,\u00a0piano,\u00a0acoustic guitar,\u00a0and a wide variety of\u00a0non-Western acoustic instruments, and\u00a0electronic\u00a0forms, frequently relying on sustained\u00a0synth pads\u00a0or long\u00a0sequencer-based runs. Vocal arrangements were initially rare in the genre, but as it has evolved vocals have become more common especially those featuring\u00a0Native American-,\u00a0Sanskrit-, or\u00a0Tibetan-influenced chants, or lyrics based on\u00a0mythology\u00a0such as\u00a0Celtic legends.\n\n===Spotify playlists===\n\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/71A8ZTnUbzUNXPJwBTN7jf?si=7DoeoKn3SJ-3ni7ufFITWA Chakra Healing Frequencies \ud83e\uddd8\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Solfeggio Spotify playlist by Miracle Tones]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/04RUTryB4YaoLcXlc5B8gv?si=iPD-rt7ATVyl4n39n20YhA Chakra Cleansing Music Spotify playlist by chakrameditationspecialists]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2UZcv1q1kz2YV5iuFVc00K?si=NJYym-qoR7WDnMc4eBYLuQ Mantras - Yoga - Meditation - Stress Relief - Healing Music and Chakras Spotify playlist by boyrelajante]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2t1yAqPS2EtbXmyOBbLcon?si=16999c5c21664e62 Classic and New Age by Gaby Sena]\n\n====Music for each of the Western Zodiac signs (by Sonia Eryka)====\n\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/50S7QhFRU891faUCYh468V?si=rY6PDK8lRaOXwZF8iC_fXg Aries]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6hCCa6DCceRHnjLtHJljnM?si=2iKImbjJQc2zf3FNalF1DQ Taurus]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6PE07VfP8GbR7YkK9Juzry?si=b3mNxJzkRDyh8r2nU6T5HA Gemini]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6pbb0RWJwvDMpbLMiQwWUE?si=gIcdIkY0QsadXVL5LGXWzA Cancer]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/69QEcAMq1O9nkWtz6ww4JK?si=fkqnETXhQZuTs7mcl-FO0A Leo]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4nim5yXDYAoG0ZvYWEunVP?si=iY7uKU6rQiyj5VuOT9UGqw Virgo]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4jFIe1g8sGZ8r2N54gJgfy?si=hoVfU9_zQryAZV9JG8UchA Libra]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7y9gmy4uPXliAffb19f40Q?si=7hOe5WyxSjeH5BPHcrFqmQ Scorpio]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4YGAQKt65HcxKPK6dXAx6M?si=P5TGDKGRQIeo9sYk8tX9zg Sagittarius]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2IeP3XP4ItspEmA10cqcKp?si=tu5WNwb0QJGgG-Gfoi1BCQ Capricorn]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2iWzbLA8yjC6bUG9hUdIZ9?si=XGubs5u9SxuPQdCigLAHPw Aquarius]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2Ipr437rdVo7mbqZOIdOr3?si=HKHFrWbCTsGMrnJy7ousEg Pisces]\n\n<br />\n\n=== Pinterest Boards ===\n[https://br.pinterest.com/silverz_/signs/ Signs by Silverz](12 Western Zodiac Signs)\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"130\">\n7 Chakras by Nestaman.jpg\nChakra activation by meditation - 1.jpg\nChakras.gif|Ascension in Motion colour-chakra-and-symbol.jpg\nFondo de Chakras.jpg\nSeven-chakras-saleires-art.jpg\nThe heart chakra by malakh7-d3k3v6x.jpg|The Heart Chakra\nThroat chakra symbol by ashnandoah-d52ndhm.jpg|The Throat Chakra\nThird Eye Chakra by gloriagypsy.jpg|The Third Eye Chakra\nChakrawave.jpg\nDownload (2)-0.jpg\nHoroscope ByNikolay Tolmachev .jpg\nZodiac ross.jpg\nZod\u00edaco - Solo Show By Sonia Lazo.jpg\nCelestial.jpg\nCelestial 3.jpg\nCelestial 5.jpg\n200wx.gif\nMoonnncore.jpg\n</gallery>\n<br />\n[[Category:Music]]\n[[Category:Visual]]\n[[Category:Fashion]]"}}}]}}}}
