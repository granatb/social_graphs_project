This is done carefully as to avoid blasphemy. \n\n* Crosses\n* Virgin Mary and Jesus (often weeping)\n* Angels\n* Neon lights\n* Churches\n* Cemeteries\n* Christian statuary\n* Bible scripture\n* Religious billboards\n* Fire\n\n==Fashion==\nFashion for Christcore mainly derives from Rocker and [[Grunge]] but involves more Christian imagery and is more modest. Common themes are lace, leather, boots, and white. Crosses are obviously one of the most recurring symbols and are either worn as accessories or as patterns on clothes. \n\n==Music==\nChristcore also refers to\u00a0hardcore punk\u00a0bands that promote\u00a0Christian\u00a0beliefs. How these bands promote Christianity, and to what extent, varies between bands. Christian hardcore bands often openly state their\u00a0beliefs and employ Christian imagery in their lyrics, and may be considered a part of the\u00a0Christian music industry. Some bands that play or have played Chirstcore include:\n\n* [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flyleaf_(band) Flyleaf]\n*[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phinehas_(band) Phinehas]\n*[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Devil_Wears_Prada_(band) The Devil Wears Prada]\n*[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underoath Underoath]\n*[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/August_Burns_Red August Burns Red]\n*[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrice Thrice]\n*[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anberlin Anberlin]\n*[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopesfall Hopesfall]\n*[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stavesacre Stavesacre]\n*[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Red_Jumpsuit_Apparatus The Red Jumpsuit Apparatus]\n\n==== Subgenres ====\n\n* '''''Christian Rap'''''\n* '''''Christian Trap''''' <sub>(</sub> <sub>Mostly popular in Latin America )</sub>\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery orientation=\"square\" widths=\"130\">\nA823888f11a3ad82bb12c2d6eca982b1.jpg\nTumblr pufu07M4Zr1yq0kw5o1 400.jpg\n7696376f7109896294ef77a0f73fe1b8.jpg\n7fbbe95838eb5b4f30475cf7fd5ae86b.jpg\nE043b65637a9aa63972f8c6abb212bc1.jpg\nC4123f6bd0ed47108930158d51d7c89e.jpg\nChrist-11-cropped.jpg\nDemon-angel.jpg\nJeabus.jpg\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Core Suffix]]\n[[Category:Visual]]\n[[Category:Music]]\n[[Category:Fashion]]"}}}]}}}}
