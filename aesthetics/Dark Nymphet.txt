Here, the aesthetic is grungier and addresses additional topics such as drug addiction, kidnapping, sado-masochism, and crime.\n\n<br />\n\n== Controversy ==\n''This article is under construction''\n<br />\n\n== Visuals ==\nThe visuals of Dark Nymphet are [[Grunge|Grungier]] and have a darker color palette compared to other types of nymphets such as [[Nymphet]] and [[Key West Kitten]], as there is a gray-ish blue washed out tinge to most photographs. The images also look less polished in that messy hair and make-up, grainy photography and video, and dirty locations are common traits.\n\n<br />\n\n== Media ==\n\n=== Movies ===\n\n* ''Buffalo '66'' (1998)\n* ''Lolita'' (1962) and (1997)\n*''Black lolita'' (1975)\n\n<br />\n\n== Anime/Manga ==\n\n* ''Higanbana no saku no yoru ni''\n\n<br />\n\n== Books ==\n\n* ''The Butterfly Garden -'' Dot Hutchinson\n* ''Lolita'' - Vladimir Nabokov\n\n\n\n\n== Music ==\n\n* <nowiki>''</nowiki>Black lolita<nowiki>''</nowiki> - Lord of the lost\n* <nowiki>''</nowiki>Tag, you're it<nowiki>''</nowiki> - Melanie Martinez\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nFile:Dark nymphet devon.jpg\nFile:Dark nymphet pointe.jpg\nFile:Dark nymphet gun.jpg\nFile:Dark nymphet the house that jack built.jpg\nFile:Dark nymphet mag.jpg\nFile:Dark nymphet 66.jpg\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Needs work]]\n[[Category:Feminine]]\n[[Category:Sensitive Content]]\n[[Category:Sexy]]\n[[Category:Candidates for Deletion]]"}}}]}}}}
