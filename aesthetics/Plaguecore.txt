The community is super friendly although behind their masks you might not know, but they are willing to listen to your needs and they'll do their best to cure you. But if you upset them they will be sure to mess up your humors.\n\nThe aesthetic revolves around mostly black and grays, leeches, bloodletting, lavender, cloaks, bird masks, and dark humor. This aesthetic was also created on Tumblr: [https://www.tumblr.com/tagged/plaguecore Posts tagged with plaguecore on Tumblr]\n\n\n==Fashion==\nPlaguecore fashion mostly consists of medieval plague doctor outfits. Many people choose to wear these because plaguecore is based on plague doctors. But because there are many people who can't afford to buy plague doctor outfits, doctors (people who do plaguecore) have been nice enough to make a list of things that modern doctors can dress in for plaguecore.\n\nThis modern plaguecore attire follows mostly: \n\n*Black\n*Long dresses\n*Suits\n*Leather, especially coats\n*Rubber boots\n*Dark sunglasses\n* Lavender perfume/deodorant\n*You\u2019re most at home in liminal spaces, because you, too, are just a little out of sync with the world\n*You\u2019re not sure what\u2019s going on but you\u2019re doing your best\n*Looking scary and goth but being kind and well-meaning\n* You manage to be both a Respected Person of Science and Local Cryptid who Lives in a Cave\n<gallery widths=\"185\">\nClassic-plague-doctor-costume-.jpg\nClassic-plague-doctor-costume.jpg\n</gallery>\n<br />\n\n==Visuals==\n\n* Abandoned buildings\n*Graveyards\n*Masks and mask collections (medical and/or decorative)\n*Bookshelves\n*Small trinkets, especially homemade\n*Leather-bound books\n*Dark red wine\n*Lanterns\n*Incense\n*Houseplants\n*Crows\n*Leeches\n*Rats\n\n==Activities==\n\n*Living in the year 2020\n*Nighttime walks\n*Walking through the forest\n*Walking through graveyards<br />\n\n== Media Characters==\n\n* Kai Chisaki (My Hero Academia) \n* SCP-049 (SCP Foundation)\n* The Plague Doctor (\"Hawkman\" - DC Comics)\n* Robert Merivel (Restoration)<br />\n==Music==\n[https://youtu.be/nTrD3sv1XW8 \"The Great Mortality\" By Apocalypse Orchestra]\n[https://youtu.be/eWErKW5fDZ0 \"PLAGUE DOCTOR\" By Morbid Hallucinations]\n\n==Gallery==\n<br />\n[[Category:Needs work]]"}}}]}}}}
