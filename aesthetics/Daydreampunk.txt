It consists of bright or pastel \"magical\" colors with fantasy elements such as unicorns or fairies laid out on a punk canvas. It takes inspiration heavily from late 2000s and early 2010s trends and aesthetics for young/tween girls. It can consist of bright galaxy prints, tie-dye, studded denim, and holographic punk-style shoes. It bears some resemblance to the [[Spacecore]], [[Holosexual]], and [[Unicorncore]] genres.\n\n== Visual==\n== Fashion ==\n== Media ==\n== Music ==\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nFile:308E8A33-7292-4B0E-A02C-B12898062CCB.jpg\nFile:FA555CCD-60FC-4F4A-AFDF-27E6EAD1EBCE 4 5005 c.jpeg\nFile:1992ED75-D504-42BA-A200-28EF31E686AE.jpg\nFile:7A34FFB5-DF08-441E-8622-FDFAC117A786.jpg\nFile:21CB1FAC-116D-477E-A11C-7D73A9D086C8 4 5005 c.jpg\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Candidates for Deletion]]\n[[Category:Needs work]]\n[[Category:Punk Suffix]]\n[[Category:Cute]]"}}}]}}}}
