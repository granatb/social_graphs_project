The term is particularly common in the computing and electronics industries, in circuit bending, as well as among players of video games. More generally, all types of systems including human organizations and nature experience glitches.\n\nA glitch, which is slight and often temporary, differs from a more serious software bug which is a genuine functionality-breaking problem. Alex Pieschel, writing for Arcade Review, said: \"\u201cbug\u201d is often cast as the weightier and more blameworthy pejorative, while \u201cglitch\u201d suggests something more mysterious and unknowable inflicted by surprise inputs or stuff outside the realm of code.\"\n\n== Visual ==\nThe glitched look is frequently featured in both [[Vaporwave]] and [[Lo-Fi]] works (with the rare instance it shows up in some [[Synthwave]] videos when it's trying to completely replicate the 80's look, like it's a lost video showing its age).\n\n== Fashion ==\n'''Glitch Fashion'''\n* [https://liveheroes.com/en/brand/dataerase Dataerase]\n\n== Music ==\n\n=== Genres ===\nDigicore (also people call it glitchcore)\n\n=== Spotify playlist ===\n\n* [https://open.spotify.com/user/cbelle06/playlist/6B1bn8EdpgZbQmUMohQRjz glitchcore <3 playlist by cbelle06]\n* [https://open.spotify.com/user/spotify/playlist/37i9dQZF1DWUraJYejk11q Genre Glitch Official Spotify Playlist]\n* [https://open.spotify.com/user/wmcwz80542gmouid29y6sbosg/playlist/7334uxq7NumEFUh2zXUNKE xXx_gLiTcHcOrE_xXx playlist by ashleigh]\n* [https://open.spotify.com/user/plewin1/playlist/2J14CPCcUOs34Sj83uMgTC GLITCHCORE playlist by plewin1]\n* [https://open.spotify.com/user/tatehatestate/playlist/1yWlSn35eKBXd2mRRnQgPi GLITCH playlist by TATUM]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2n7qnrriX9gPWcagWNVhEb GLITCHCORE \ud83d\ude3c\ud83d\ude3c\ud83d\ude39\ud83d\ude3b playlist by isabellakio]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/75aJwc49gRL55wqJUeKV49 over 40 hours of hyperpop glitchcore and escape room by cool name]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5QJmCrUgixHsYmUewmr4vc?si=b78db364384c49ad black cuff beanie Spotify Playlist]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3uWdXhH0QbhOJfqfmIxRI7?si=79753cc152094014 Drain Gang Spotify Playlist]\n\n[[File:Bubblegum-0|thumb]]\n== Datamosh ==\n'''Datamosh''', (or '''Databending''') is a complex glitch technique where \nthe movement in one layer of video is applied to another layer of \nfootage, using glossy compression and removed frames to create a \nglitchy, psychedelic result. \n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\n\n<gallery widths=\"130\" orientation=\"square\" spacing=\"small\">\nImages.jpg\n4FfdDN.jpg\nTumblr n8oa2mjywx1qdjkbho1 500.gif|An example of Datamoshing\nDatamoshexercise1\nDatamosh.PNG\nQmT.gif\nSource.gif\nTwo Girls GIF.gif\n3deb63b56ff7eddf96eb76e59325e5cb.jpg|Glitchcore Nagito Komaeda\nTumblr bee09fb796685f82a917a9e007a69764 06496662 500 (1).png|Kokichi Oma\nHGHDJ2H22222 HDIWJHDWJNDW4567234.jpg|glitchcore edit\nGlitch core.jpg|mix of glitchy anime boys >:)\nGlitchcore pfp.gif|Hiyoko Saionji Glitchcore edit\nGlitchcore.jpg|Calne Ca Glitchcore Edit\nDownload (2).jpg\n33AC863F-34BE-4590-B30F-1CDAFB8202A5.jpeg|link=Glitch|Junko Enoshima glitchcore\n336359421059201.webp|helllloooo danganronpa fandom <3\nGlitchcorekuromierror.gif\nA96307ff8470160c90013b8ff1dea2fa.jpg\nFed0f0017f0156f3eb034c715f1fac873106e8f7r1-1024-1022v2 hq.jpg|Chiaki Glitchcore!!\nDhh6yl0at5q61.jpg\nAb67706c0000bebb2f0a2a88fd2ca84f1782a3d2.jpg\n2e60ae377483b3823893c857b96261a2.jpg\nArtworks-02FMICGbGvJyJZEA-2WnH7A-t500x500.jpg\nF490FAE9-D3A2-4FF5-847C-6D326799F4F8.jpeg\nArtworks-37g7d181sXYX9RfJ-AzouGg-t500x500.jpg|Himiko Toga\nEc-y26sX0AA9aoI.jpg|Ibuki Mioda glitch\nFile:Sao.png\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Visual]]\n[[Category:Music]]\n[[Category:Fashion]]"}}}]}}}}
