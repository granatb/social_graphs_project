Its followers are deeply philosophical by nature and have a great interest in studying the human condition often through psychology, philosophy, and the occult. For this reason occult clothing, symbology and sacred geometry is a vast part of the Nu Goth aesthetic and fashion.\n\n\n\n\n== Fashion ==\nThe main characteristic of the fashion is black, gray and white outfits with occult prints and accessories. Nu-goth fashion is very modern and sleek. \n\n* Crosses\n*Pentagrams\n* Round sunglasses\n* Fashion harness\n*Moons\n*Creepers\n* Crop tops\n* High waist shorts\n* Leggings\n*Inverted crosses\n* Doc martens\n* Black lipstick\n*Stars\n\n<br />\n== Music ==\nPopular bands among Nu Goth include Zola Jesus, Humanfobia, Salem, White Ring, Siouxie & The Banshees, Bauhaus, and Switchblade Symphony among many others from the Batcave and Post-Punk era. Also genres like Witch House & Wave music. It is important to note that Nu Goth supports and encourages self discovery above all else. Within the subculture, people are encouraged to listen to all genres of music to expand one's sense of self. For this reason, it is not uncommon to run into those who listen to Metal or Post-Hardcore.\n\n<br />\n=='''Resources'''==\n\n=== Vendors ===\nBe cautious of the vendors you seek, many have negative reputations surrounding company beliefs, misuse of funds, and treatment of workers.\n\n*[https://rogueandwolf.com/ Rogue and Wolf]\n*[https://www.blackcraftcult.com/ Black Craft Cult]\n*[https://dropdead.world/ Drop Dead]\n*[https://www.killstar.com/ Killstar]\n*[https://longclothing.com/ Long Clothing]\n\n===Pinterest Boards===\n\n*[https://www.pinterest.com/Lady_Hydra/nu-goth/ Nu-Goth by Lady Hydra]\n*[https://www.pinterest.com/noelmp3/nu-goth-and-causal-goth/ nu goth (and causal goth) by nol]\n*[https://www.pinterest.com/dagui94/nu-goth-pastel-goth/ Nu Goth & pastel Goth by Alma]\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery widths=\"185\">\nNu-anti-valentine.jpg\nNu-dress.jpg\nNu-seance-dress.jpg\nNu-shorts.jpg\nNu-skort.jpg\nFile:Tumblr oygefdRKIu1wbx8mzo1 640.jpg\nNu-split-hair.jpg\nNu-star.jpg\nNugoth1.jpg\nFile:Classic edgy.jpeg\nFile:Edgy.jpeg\n7a125f9f5253e89509cf9bb8387702745f85838dr1-640-1161v2 hq.jpg\nB6cbd79a589e98f2395316fa331ab15e4d2a14aar1-327-564v2 hq.jpg\n44f047bb0372e9b55dcfc17671e7b14475548dbdr1-500-475v2 hq.jpg\nFile:Romantic Goth.jpg\nFile:Shoes nu goth.jpeg\nFile:Nu goth cute.jpeg\nFile:Classic Nu goth.jpeg\nFile:Nu goth.jpg\n</gallery><br />\n[[Category:Goth Suffix]]\n[[Category:Fashion]]\n[[Category:Needs work]]"}}}]}}}}
