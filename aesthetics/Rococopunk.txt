Although it is a fairly recent derivative, it is a style that is visually similar to the\u00a0[[New Romantic]]\u00a0movement of the 1980s (particularly such groups as\u00a0Adam and the Ants). Rococopunk has most recently been featured on ''The X Factor'' through the artist known as ''Prince Poppycock''. Fashion designer ''Vivienne Westwood'', often known as \"the Queen of Punk Fashion\", also mixes Rococo with punk stylings.<ref>[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberpunk_derivatives Wikipedia - Cyberpunk Derivatives]</ref>\n\n==Resources==\n===References===\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Punk Suffix]]\n[[Category:Fashion]]\n[[Category:Needs work]]\n[[Category:Feminine]]\n[[Category:Candidates for Deletion]]"}}}]}}}}
