It has had a widespread influence, ranging from the arts to lifestyle.\n\nAs an art movement, minimalism began in post-WWII Western art, and was most prominent in the 1960s through the early 1970s. It is strongly influenced from the reductive aspects associated with some parts of Modernism, including [[Suprematism]], [[Purism]], and [[De Stijl]].\n\nThe art movement has had a significant influence on Minimalism as a lifestyle, which is a rejection of consumerist trends with an emphasis on simple living. This lifestyle has become increasingly prominent since 2010, and is commonly associated with The Minimalists.\n\n== Visual ==\nMinimalism refers to a lack of clutter. This means that visuals tend to be very simple and remove unnecessary details. Solid colors are very common. Simple patterns may also appear; anything that is complex will not. Colors also tend to be very muted.\n\n=== Pinterest ===\n* [https://www.pinterest.com/nordhaven/minimal/ MINIMAL] (interior design)\n* [https://www.pinterest.com/guitamoda/minimal/ Minimal] (fashion)\n* [https://www.pinterest.com/thepeoplesprints/minimalism/ Minimalism] (art)\n* [https://www.pinterest.com/sennerholt/minimal/ [minimal]]\n\n=== Artists ===\n* Carl Andre\n* Anthony Caro\n* Dan Flavin\n* Al Held\n* Donald Judd\n* Ellsworth Kelly\n* Sol LeWitt\n* Agnes Martin\n* John McCracken\n* Robert Morris\n* Kenneth Noland\n* Robert Ryman\n* David Smith\u00a0\n* Tony Smith\n* Frank Stella\n* Anne Truit\n\n==Fashion==\nMinimal fashion is simple and quiet and doesn't have bold and bright colours like other aesthetics.

As the name implies, it blends elements of the [[Indie]] aesthetic along with the otherwise Minimalist aesthetics.\n\n====Colors====\nThe color palette is usually based around white, black, navy, and light gray or blue, with one or two bright accents. Also, the minimalism side is heavily influenced by the bright colors and clean lines of Bauhaus and Modernist design.\n====Fashion====\nIndie style means basically just whatever feels right based on your personal aesthetic, and usually involves avoiding mainstream labels. Minimalism is just what it sounds like: a little. This often means a spare, neutral palette, clean lines, and a focus on function and practicality first. So, indie minimalism is a combination of these styles, usually involving basics like a white button-down shirt or jeans outfits with one or two distinctive touches of color. You can get inspiration from urban street-style (as long as you are dressing for yourself rather than to show off to others) or find clothes in thrift shops and vintage stores if you like to shop.\n=====Brands=====\n\n*[https://www.thecustommovement.com The Custom Movement]\n*[https://caroncallahan.com Caron Callahan]\n*[https://www.oliveclothing.com Olive]\n*[https://kitristudio.com Kitri]\n*[https://www.needsupply.com Need Supply Co.]\n\n====Activities====\n\n*Photography\n*Watching or producing independent films\n*Listening to indie music (Independently released '''music''' is not directly financially dependent on any of the four major labels (WMG, Sony BMG, EMI and Universal. \"'''Indie'''\" '''does''' not refer to a style of '''music'''; it refers to the financial circumstances of its distribution.)\n\n\n====Resources====\nA list of external links to help get a better understanding of this aesthetic.\n\n=====Instagram=====\n\n*[https://www.instagram.com/_indies_minimal/ _indies_minimal]\n*[https://www.instagram.com/girlafrenda/ girlafrenda]\n*[https://www.instagram.com/tomomo714/ tomomo714]\n*[https://www.instagram.com/indies_gram/ indies_gram]\n*[https://www.instagram.com/tsuno2no/ tsuno2no]\n{{Aesthetic\n|title1             = Pastel Minimalism\n|key_colours        = Pastel Pink, blue, green, mint, yellow\n|related_aesthetics = [[Pastel]]\n|image1             = Pastel desk.jpg|caption1=An example of Pastel Minimalist imagery.|key_motifs=Light colors, emptiness, photography|key_values=An everyday object with a pastel background.}}\n===Pastel Minimalism===\n\n'''Pastel Minimalism''' combines [[pastel]] colors with small, ordinary subject matter or simple architecture.

It can be described as clean, light, simple, functional, and minimal.\n\nMatcha often employs the use of a single muted color, or a muted color palette, against a white or black backdrop. Common materials include brushed metal, wood, paper, matte plastic, cork, felt, and ceramic.\n\nMatcha design encourages sensory specificity as a means to turning daily experiences into pleasing rituals. Accordingly, it overlaps with some vintage technologies whose daily usage conjures sounds, smells, and textures (eg. vinyl record albums, cassette tapes, mechanical typewriters, and paper stationery).\n\nTypographic elements are carefully crafted in Matcha design, and often feature as part of, rather than simply accessory to, the overall design of an object.\n\nMatcha draws from the simplicity of minimalism, but places an added emphasis on sensory delight. While it shares some elements with [[Comfy/Cozy]], including a ritualized ease in daily activities, it is not confined to a set of behaviors. Similarly, it overlaps with the warmth of [[Coffee House/Cafe|Coffee House]], but with an added emphasis on the experience of objects in themselves, and not simply as part of a larger environment.\n\n====Stores & Brands====\n\n*[https://postalco.com/en POSTALCO]\n*[https://www.shopkanso.com/ KANSO]\n*[https://www.muji.com/us/ MUJI]\n*[https://kinto-usa.com/ KINTO]\n*[https://www.fjallraven.com/us/en-us Fjallraven]\n\n====Visual Arts====\n\n*[http://www.artnet.com/artists/yoshitomo-nara/ Yoshitomo Nara]\n\n====Music====\n\n*[https://www.sitesakamoto.com/discography Ryuichi Sakamoto]\n\n====Activities====\n\n*Making tea or coffee\n*Drinking tea or coffee\n*Typing on the computer\n*Reading a book\n*Tidying a room\n*Lighting a candle\n*Putting on a vinyl record\n\n==Gallery==\n===Minimalism===\n<gallery widths=\"130\" spacing=\"small\">\nMin1.jpg\nTumblr drawing source unknown.jpg\nMinimal-Minimalist Drawing Art.png\nMinimal-Minimalist Plant.webp\nMinimal-Minimalist Visual.jpeg\nMinimal-Minimalist Fashion2.jpeg\nMinimal-Minimalist Fashion.jpeg\nGridsheet.jpg\nLook2.JPG\nDont Quit.jpeg\nTumblr_mr18gaeVgs1sv1655o1_500.png\nTumblr_msegy70ZHn1suaeyxo1_1280.jpg\nTumblr_n5y0r7nnXg1qe4u56o3_500.png\n</gallery>\n\n===Pastel Minimalism===\n<gallery widths=\"130\" spacing=\"small\">\nMacaron.jpg\n1592639.jpg\nIcecreamstick.jpg\nTowelbowl.jpg\nCactuspastel.jpg\nPinkbanana.jpg\nDcfdbbb78374f28ac0390c6a8be2de0d.jpg\n40415602-79DA-41F3-B191-0216D71B9E44.jpeg\n</gallery>\n\n===Indie Minimalism===\n<gallery widths=\"130\" spacing=\"small\">\nIndieMin.01.png|Fashion inspiration with neutral colors and an urban background\nIndieMin.07.PNG\nIndieMin.02.PNG|Another example of style inspiration\nIndieMin.06.PNG\nIndieMin.08.PNG\nIndieMin.09.PNG|link=https://www.thecustommovement.com/custom/9fB7GD8V/butterfly\nIndieminimalist.webp\n</gallery>\n\n===Matcha Minimalism===\n<gallery widths=\"130\" spacing=\"small\">\nFile:Afteroom Lounge Chair.jpg\nFile:POSTALCO One Year Wall Calendar 2021.png\nFile:Menu Bottle Grinders.jpg\nFile:Ceramic indoor outdoor wallscape planters.jpg\nFile:Matcha Keyboard.jpg\nFile:Kinto Day Off Tumbler.jpg\nFile:Hasami Porcelain Mug in Black.jpg\n</gallery>\n<br />\n==References==\n* https://www.theartstory.org/movement/minimalism/\n* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimalism Wikipedia\n<references =\"0\"=\"\" />\n[[Category:Visual]]\n[[Category:Needs work]]\n[[Category:Fashion]]\n[[Category:Art]]\n[[Category:Art movements]]\n[[Category:Mature]]\n[[Category:Ism suffix]]\n[[Category:2010s]]"}}}]}}}}
