The art of classicism typically seeks to be formal and restrained. It is a specific genre of philosophy, expressing itself in literature, architecture, art, and music, which has Ancient Greek and Roman sources and an emphasis on\u00a0society.\n\nIn some situations, classicism can be politicized by white nationalists with the intention of creating an impression of \"Western culture\" from many diverse cultures. This can then be portrayed as \"what we [the white race] are protecting,\" an ahistorical medley of very different \"white\" cultures. ([https://youtu.be/hyaftqCORT4 Source.]) Note that while this may be difficult to distinguish from legitimate cultural study in some cases, that is the purpose of such politicization; it prevents everyone from immediately seeing through the veil of cryptofascism. This by no means forms the majority of the classicist aesthetic, however (and thankfully).\n\nFor the modern reinterpretation of classicism based on mythology, see [[Hellenic]].\n\n== Early Classicism ==\n<br />\n\n== Classicism ==\n<br />\n\n== Late Classicism ==\n<br />\n\n== Roman Republic ==\n<br />\n\n== Roman Empire ==\n<br />\n\n== Renaissance ==\nRenaissance art was primarily produced in Italy; in particular, the cities of Florence, Venice, and Rome. This movement lasted from roughly 1300-1600, though it wasn\u2019t quite a distinct art style until the late 1400s. Secularism and an interest in the Classical past were highly influential to this art style. Renaissance art is characterized by symmetry, a linear perspective (which better represented the world), the use of space, accurate depiction of detail (naturalism), and the effect of light.<ref>Little, Stephen (2004). <em>. . . isms: Understanding Art</em>.

Neoclassical art was traditional and new, historical and modern, conservative and progressive all at the same time.\n== Coloration ==\nWhile followers of the aesthetic tend to prize white marble, which influenced the Renaissance to Neoclassical movements, scientific analysis and primary sources of the time revealed that the Greeks and Romans actually painted their sculptures, often in colors that modern viewers would find unappealing.<ref>https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/10/29/the-myth-of-whiteness-in-classical-sculpture</ref> Despite this new information, fans of the classical aesthetic do not include painted marble in their photographs or moodboards, and instead focus more on works from the later artistic movements. \n\n<br />\n\n== Literature ==\n\n=== Literature ===\n''Odyssey''  by Homer\n\n=== Mythology ===\n\n* ''The Iliad'' by Homer\n\n=== Philosophy ===\n\n* ''Symposium'' by Plato\n* ''Corpus Aristotelicum by Aristotle''\n\n\n\n== Fashion ==\n<br />\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery widths=\"185\">\nThe school of athens.jpg|The School of Athens by Raphael\nThe Parthenon Athens.jpg\nVenus de milo.jpeg\nSiphnian treasury with color.jpg|A modern reconstruction of what the painted buildings would have looked like\nLuv.png\nClassicism_style.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n== References ==\n[[Category:Written]]\n[[Category:Visual]]\n[[Category:Art]]\n[[Category:Needs work]]\n[[Category:Art movements]]\n<references />\n[[Category:Ism suffix]]"}}}]}}}}
