It can revolve around city streets, graffiti, skate parks at night, and picnics. Similar to [[High School Dream]], this aesthetic embodies a youthful and somewhat rebellious spirit of a teen living in a nostalgic time. \n\n\n==Visuals==\nAs expected, Urbancore aesthetics focus heavily on the city and city life.\n\n*vandalism\n*graffiti\n* industrial architecture\n**rooftops, alleyways, spaces between buildings\n**train stations\n**worn-down/empty buildings\n** skyscrapers\n**concrete\n\n*street fixtures, such as benches, street lamps, road signs\n*urban exploration\n**unpopulated buildings such as warehouses\n** barren concrete stairwells\n*dirty areas\n** garbage clutter\n**dumpsters\n**concrete rubble\n\n== Fashion==\nUrbancore fashion draws heavily from [[Skater]], [[Art Hoe]], [[Hip-Hop]] and [[Nostalgiacore]] fashion, since this aesthetic is fairly active, a lot of the clothing is fashionable and breathable.  A very particular kind of Urbancore fashion, '''Streetwear''', is a style of casual clothing which became global in the 1990s. It grew from Californian surf and skate culture to encompass elements of sportswear, hip hop, punk and Japanese street fashion and continued to grow and evolve from there.  \n\nThis style can also be closely related to the [[Baddie]] aesthetic, which gravitates to brands like Nike, Jordan, and Louis Vuttion. This style includes:\n\nSome Urbancore staples are:\n\n*baggy pants or sweatpants (sometimes highly decorated with different textiles)\n*brand-name oversized t-shirts/vintage brand name t-shirts\n*dad hats/caps\n*fanny packs\n*short bubble/puffer jackets\n*customized pants\n*sports bras/ racerback bras\n*overalls\n*brightly colored socks\n*sneakers (usually Nike or Jordan) or flat-bottomed skating shoes\n*sweaters over collared shirts\n*chains/pants chains\n*cargo pants\n*flannels\n*plaid skirts\n\n[[File:High_end_fashion,_streetwear,_art_&_pop_culture-0.jpg|thumb|231x231px|link=https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/File:High_end_fashion,_streetwear,_art_&_pop_culture-0.jpg]]\n'''High-End Streetwear''' (also known as Hypebeast) is a materialistic lifestyle that devotes oneself to buying, owning and wearing usually expensive and fashionable clothing, instead of usual Streetwear fashion, the brands that are worn are very expensive and even worshiped to some extent.  \n\nIts focus is to bring out a high end version of typical hypebeast fashion and regular streetwear mixed together. This style usually has clothing items that people would consider \"[https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Drip drip]\". This style is somewhat looked down on in the fashion community because of its \"big logo + hype shoes = fashion\" mentality. This look can include:\n\n*cargo pants (bright or dark colors)\n*bucket hats (very popular amongst the high-end streetwear community)\n*Large T-Shirts, sweatshirts with brand logos or imagery\n*branded Jackets/outerwear\n*very expensive shoes/customized shoes\n*expensive customized clothing\n*Basically any high end clothing with noticable logos\n\n[[File:Aleali_May_styles_Siobhan_Bell_in_a_vintage_t-shirt_for_\u201csummer_90s_basketball_vibes_\u201d.jpg|thumb|224px|Urbanwear|alt=|link=https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/File:Aleali_May_styles_Siobhan_Bell_in_a_vintage_t-shirt_for_%E2%80%9Csummer_90s_basketball_vibes_%E2%80%9D.jpg]]\n\nAlso popular in Urbancore is '''Techwear''', clothing that serves a functionality other than acting as a body covering.
