Despite the contradicting styles, 2 Tone blends these genres, making for a faster rendition of the ska genre. Many 2 Tone songs are in fact covers of Jamaican songs, such as 'A Message to You, Rudy', 'Monkey Man', and 'Time Hard'. The name comes from the record label of the same name, which was founded by Jerry Dammers, keyboardist of The Specials. Between its music and visuals, 2 Tone became a significant subculture in the British alternative music scene. Fans of 2 Tone are often referred to as '''Rude Boys''' (or\u00a0'''rudeboy''',\u00a0'''rudie''',\u00a0'''rudi''', and\u00a0'''rudy'''). Rude Boy came from a slang term that originated from 1960s Jamaican street culture.\n\nComing along at a time of great upheaval in Thatcher-era Britain, 2 Tone providing youth with an outlet for their discontent and an escape through dancing. Also a key aspect of both the 2 Tone label, music, and the bands themselves was promoting equality and denouncing racism. The checkerboard motif symbolizes a union between the races, and many 2 Tone bands had both black and white members.\n== Music ==\n\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDzGMIFPk-w The Specials - Nite Klub]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf7v1iWc4tk The Selecter - Too Much Pressure]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1MlBzPvCsMo The Beat - Ranking Full Stop]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLLL1KxpYMA Madness - Night Boat to Cairo]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzkTTA0YQe4 Bad Manners - Lorraine]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA2ziMClB_0 The Bodysnatchers - Do The Rocksteady]\n\n=== Videos ===\n\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVexewVb2B4 Dance Craze (1981 concert movie featuring many 2 Tone bands)]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THl-B4_nHsU&ab_channel=Ska%2F2Tone 2 Tone Mix]\n\n== Visuals/Fashion ==\nAlong with\u00a0ska\u00a0and\u00a0rocksteady\u00a0music, many rude boys favored sharp suits, thin ties, and\u00a0pork pie\u00a0or\u00a0Trilby\u00a0hats, showing an influence of the fashions of American\u00a0jazz\u00a0musicians,\u00a0soul music\u00a0artists, and the original Jamaican rude boys themselves. There was some crossover with the mod and skinhead subcultures as well. In later years, the checkerboard motif gained more prominence among ska fans, often adorning various clothes and accessories, perhaps the most popular among latter-day rudies being Vans sneakers. \n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\n\nFile:The-specials.jpg|The Specials, a favorite among 2 Tone ska fans.\nFile:2tone1.jpg\nFile:2tone3.jpg\nFile:2tone2.jpg\nFile:05iht-rudeboy05A-superJumbo.jpg|An example of Rude Boy fashion.\n\n</gallery>\n\n[[Category:Music]]\n[[Category:Needs work]]"}}}]}}}}
