It started as a subgenre of House music that was popular in raves (which could draw some comparisons to [[Raver]] culture) but has evolved into a full blown aesthetic in its own right.\n\n\n== Visual ==\nAcidwave visuals have a very melty, psychedelic, and colorful appearance, often drawing upon the tie-dye imagery that was popular in the days of the [[Hippie]]s. Despite that, some Acidwave aesthetic imagery can have a dark, unsettling vibe to them (like a bad acid trip) as well as a peaceful, tranquil vibe (like a good acid trip).\n\nExtra: Film: The hotel on acid (1998)\n\n=== Pinterest Boards ===\n\n* [https://www.pinterest.com/mariecat71725/acid-wave/ Acid Wave by Maggie.M]\n\n== Music ==\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0mmkT2soKEcJvDmvUwUEoO \u26a1AESTHETIC: acidwave/psychedelica] by Chaotic Good\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2TFtaPGM35P5s7v99YDWhU?si=262c1BwnQEaBjmNfoBn2hA Acidwave \ud83c\udf86 Spotify playlist by Cesar Nieto]\n* [https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7Mj0a2ydZF1fN72VIgRnv0?si=P07Q7WKoSga3QpK8iP073g aCiD wAvE Spotify playlist by lceman_333]\n* [https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7DQFz22OFEkVit0jCrH2NY?si=-tzzGZVwTS2Eog20DOYHQQ acidwave Spotify playlist by celadatati]\n* [https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DXbwcS5W73XRr?si=mwwOlcohSNKM_dTZhUPrbQ Acid House Spotify playlist by the folks at Spotify]\n* [https://open.spotify.com/playlist/17buGP6jTSgqYoV4NwkMdX?si=5YBVADElTuyLmvWkDqQYRg The Sound of Acid House Spotify playlist by The Sounds of Spotify]\n** [https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1kBYExcskL8GQYEEciyXh5?si=JXMezZimTFa5d-1it6OoJw Intro to Acid House]\n** [https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6spctyydKOcZHjtOPqq0xv?si=IY_CtisJS2Gnr8gVT5I8Bg The Pulse of Acid House]\n** [https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0hOqv8GQ95RJQVt63jhnoi?si=jSI7aPZ4QkWAzA_RCUendA The Edge of Acid House]\n** [https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7E5SKeOHfI0nyVkz4uuHHG?si=OfV41XmFTjugB24eJESlig A \u2640Filter for Acid House]\n\n== Media ==\n[https://pin.it/vUKvkhU Acidwave board by Maggie.M]\n\n== Gallery ==\n''<gallery widths=\"130\">\nScreenshot 2020-06-19.png|Have you ever looked at the coastline?
