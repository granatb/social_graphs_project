There are needlepoint cushion covers (many now sport slogans instead of the standard floral motifs), blue and white china, lampshades in wicker, and skirts and tassels on pretty much everything. An obsession with flower frogs and roses of all colors and varieties rounds up this trend.\" -'' '''Food52''', December 12, 2019<ref>https://food52.com/blog/24846-grandmillennial-home-decor-trend</ref>\n\n=== Patterns ===\n\n* Bowood\n* Hollyhock\n* Toiles du Jouy\n* Bird & Thistle\n* Les Touches\n* Dolly\n* Roses/Floral\n\n=== Fashion ===\n\u201c''Every grandmillennial takes to this trend differently,.....
