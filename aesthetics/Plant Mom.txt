The same goes for the accounts that they have. They raise various plants (mostly flowers and succulents) as if they were their own biological children.\n\n==Visual==\nThe plant mom aesthetic is centered around plants, with a special emphasis on flowers (espechaily sunflowers) and succulents. The plant mom aesthetic often also has a slightly vintage feel, often with polaroid cameras, old watering cans and envelopes and old compendiums of plants and plant names. Some versions of the aesthetic also include bugs, often butterflies, beetles, and bees. A common decoration is plants paired with books (often on plants or nature). Another common motif is essential oils. \n\n==Fashion==\nAs depicted in the image, Plant Mom fashion has a hipster type theme and does share some aesthetic cues with the [[Art Hoe]], but the theme puts less focus on the art aspect and focuses more on a deep care for nature and raising plants in a motherly fashion. They may wear sweaters with jeans and sneakers. Outside of that particular aspect of the Plant Mom, it can relate to the rules of the Art Hoe and easily cross over into the aesthetic. This can include:\n\n* Vans and converse\n* Jeans and jean shorts \n* Loose t-shirts\n* Sneakers and tennis shoes \n* Thin wool sweatshirts \n* Plain jewelry\n* Plaid skirts and pants \n\nThey enjoy colors like yellows, especially muted or mustards, baby blue greens, dusty roses, and more muted colors in general.\n\n==Activities==\n\n*Gardening\n*Going on walks in the forest\n*Going on picnics\n*Reading\n*Photography\n*Picking or pressing flowers\n*Indoor Plants/House plants\n\n==Music==\n====Artists====\n\n*Cavetown\n*Clairo\n*girl in red\n*Lizzy McAlpine\n*Florist\n*Planttvibes\n*b o b b i e !\n*chloe moriondo\n*Billie Marten\n*Conan Gray\n* Rex Orange County\n*Beababoobee\n*Dodie\n*Tessa Violet\n*Mxmtoon\n*Tiffi\n*Frankie Cosmos\n\n==Subgenres==\n===Grunge Plant Mom===\n'''Grunge Plant Mom''' is an aesthetic that combines the grunge aesthetic with plant mom. It involves more cacti plants and grayed down backgrounds. This aesthetic keeps the plant mom motifs and values.  \n\n==Resources==\nExternal links to help get a better understanding of this aesthetic.\n\n===Vendors===\n\n*[https://www.etsy.com/market/plant_mom Etsy - Plant Mom]\n\n=====Plant Stores=====\n\n*[https://bloomscape.com/ Bloomscape]\n*[https://www.thesill.com/ The Sill]\n*[https://heyhorti.com/ Heyhorti]\n*[https://greenerynyc.com/ Greenery NYC]\n\n===Tutorials===\n\n*[https://www.gardenista.com/posts/10-easy-pieces-macrame-plant-hangers/ How to make a Plant Hanger]\n\n=== Playlists ===\n\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6NhfsBUOJUHkHDBjro6z7Z plant mom \ud83c\udf3b\ud83c\udf3f\ud83c\udf44 Spotify playlist by claire]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/66OwIpEBxzCCXiYRt9AE6m?si=wyPD8yT7RhqA2XS19jCYgQ indie plant mom\ud83c\udf31\u2728\ud83c\udf44 Spotify playlist by natalie]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5L3Ek2oZX6xtnfGentnL1F?si=ajRnR-IoSii04Cbmxo31FQ plant mom\ud83e\uddda\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83c\udf31 Spotify playlist by tcgone-us] (This playlist is collaborative, feel free to add any songs you feel fit.)\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/52R1ZQzmj6Zd4CtdQ2NjAL?si=JtAjKVjZSOuVd6g6nl1UrQ plant mom \ud83c\udf3f Spotify playlist by emmalsutton]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7z0EpZ0OPausHQh0UHi5Hf?si=gunKDjr_QriQLveOR6ZTOA \u2728plant mom\u2728 Spotify playlist by mtndew.exe]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4jQaSzGCIl7RUeXGwf127U?si=Sj3lDKqbTPKPFO4RfDGobA gay plant mom Spotify playlist by lshifflett]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/36BvaIyHSHIGc4MmH54fkG?si=ODW6OEwjTaSij5-XydBDEA soundtrack of a plant mom \ud83d\udc63\ud83c\udf31 Spotify playlist by Jillian Lloyd]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7vrvghhRWfXQcDMspNVyg9?si=Zi9ZfXwzRa6VC-ncLVRu9A Plant mom jams Spotify playlist by SHANTEL]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0OQ6uBvtmi17J8e3nhkld8?si=frR00f66S6WGmHg0314wfw \u201cbe a good plant-mom\u201d,  they said Spotify playlist by pastan]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6cSGYZADY24fO3LJ7iGjoN?si=Op9_BbJ_S-Oxe87mBJ-8Vg odes of a quarantined plant mom Spotify playlist by Hannah Chen]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1im58umq0gpZN7ntBA4WOb?si=Ootr4jbkRnqBKZ9rBrcKmg plant mom vibes Spotify playlist by trinityehrismann]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1B27D9k1uy51MBGU1xj3lj?si=_7skV_BIRqux3I1Uf3YU8g To the coolest plant mom; Spotify playlist by Wishingforthewishingwell]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0HhaERXRlaM6lewUDIFYVd?si=sQIGKQGiSoyZ_hz4cMn7Rw 2016 plant mom (you had to be there) Spotify Playlist by sleepyyjax]\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"140\" orientation=\"square\" spacing=\"small\">\n\nFile:54479a59ee291909eb5646dabe7797ac.jpg\nHerb water.jpg|Bottles of herb water.\nPlant wall in living room.jpg\n68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f594d525470772d7736376d3768513d3d2d33312e31353634323334616363643934386534333231343933.jpg|Elements of the Plant Mom aesthetic.\nSucculent.jpg\n65190091 1345706612251879 3209202482409690581 n.jpg\n9kGpm.jpeg|Grunge Plant Mom.\nFile:7b5d799e9efa8da642cb1ff20c987788.jpg\nFile:Abca1b4afd3f094a1a369dfdaebd97a8.jpg\nFile:Plants.jpg\nFile:Faucet aest.jpg\nFile:IMG 20200517 103033 768.jpg\nFile:Whitewall.jpg\n\n</gallery><br />\n[[Category:Visual]]\n[[Category:Fashion]]\n[[Category:Needs work]]"}}}]}}}}
