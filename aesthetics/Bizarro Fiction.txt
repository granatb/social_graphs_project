Previous terms used to refer to the burgeoning scene include \"irreal\"\u00a0and \"new absurdism\",\u00a0but neither of these was used broadly. On 19 June 2005, Kevin Dole II released \"What The Fuck is This All About\", a sort of manifesto for the then unnamed genre.\u00a0While the essay does not feature the word \"Bizarro,\" subsequent discussion about the essay led to the name as well as the inauguration of the Mondo Bizarro Forum.\n\nIn his essay, \"The Nab Gets Posthumously Bizarroized\",\u00a0Tom Bradley\u00a0traces the genre's roots back in literary history to the time of\u00a0Vladimir Nabokov's \"gogolization,\" and his cry of despair and horror at having his central nervous system colonized: \"...after reading\u00a0Gogol, one's eyes become gogolized. One is apt to see bits of his world in the most unexpected places.\"\u00a0Bradley claims the Bizarro movement is continuing and fulfilling that gogolization process, under the name \"Bizarroization\": \"...we have been completing the preposterous project which [Nabokov] took over from Gogol nearly a hundred years ago..\"\u00a0Bradley further asserts that Bizarro writers can trace their spiritual roots back to the\u00a0letters\u00a0which\u00a0Ovid\u00a0wrote while exiled on the\u00a0Black Sea.\n\n== Visuals ==\nThis literary genre uses every color you can think of. It doesn't have an exact pattern, texture or effect, but it mix all the things that you could imagine. Like an apocalypse with monsters made of food.\n\n== Fashion ==\nYou can use clothes, clothes with weird stuffs (images, prints, extra parts), you can also dress like any character you want. Make up: you can make and create make up like you would as a monster , etc.  However any of these things are necessary. You can wear and dress however you want, because this is most a literary genre.\n\n== Entertainment ==\nShows:\n\n* Rick and Morty\n* Planet Sheen (2010)\nMovies:\n\n* Barbarella: Queen of the Galaxy (1968)\n* The Holy mountain (1973)\n* Forbidden Zone (1982)\n* Meet the feebles (1989)\n* The dark backward (1991)\n* Cementery man (1994)\n\nBooks:\n\n* The best bizarro fiction of the decade (Cameron Pierce, 2012)\n* The bizarro starter kit (Cameron Pierce, Jeff Burk y Cody Goodfellow, 2010) \n* Hungry bug (Carlton Mellick III, 2014)\n* The big mealt (Carlton Mellick III, 2017)\n* Bio melt (Carlton Mellick III, 2015)\n\n== Music ==\nNot especific genresor artists.\n\nAlbums: \n\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_ubETxMicc Psyclopean - Celephais (full album) Lovecraft dungeon synth dark ambient weird fiction music 2019 - YouTube]\n\nSongs:\n\n* The maker: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDXOioU_OKM The Maker - YouTube]\n* Bizarro genius baby: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmx6Q0YLH8A MC Frontalot - Bizarro Genius Baby - YouTube]\n\n== Activities ==\n\n* Read bizarro fiction stories\n* Watch bizarro fiction tv\n* Writing their own bizarro fiction stories\n* Draw stuffs related to bizarro fiction\n*Film their own bizarro  music video or film \n\n== Sources ==\nPinterest: [https://www.pinterest.com/trolldanger/bizarro-fiction/ Pinterest]\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nFile:Bizarro fiction4.jpg\nFile:Bizarro fiction3.jpg\nFile:Bizarro fiction 2.jpg\nFile:Bizarro fiction1.jpg\nFile:Bizarro fiction 5.jpg\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Visual]]\n[[Category:Written]]\n[[Category:Needs work]]\n[[Category:Fiction-based aesthetics]]\n[[Category:Candidates for Deletion]]"}}}]}}}}
