Despite being mostly known for its variant that peaked in the 1990s, it already existed previously in different forms since its name was first coined in 1968. At the height of its popularity, it was not rare to see celebrities spotting this style. The tanned skin, big hair, and rebellious outfits went highly against the traditional Japanese beauty standards. While gyaru appeared very extreme in the past, it toned down as time went on.\n\n\n\nFor more information on Gyaru culture, please visit the [https://gyaru-109.fandom.com/wiki/The_Gyaru_Wikia The Gyaru Wikia] or [https://gyaru.fandom.com/wiki/Main_Page Gyaru Wiki] for a more comprehensive look into the topic and tell them the Aesthetics Wiki says hi.\n\n== Subgenres ==\n\n=== Agejo ===\n'''Agejo''' is generally worn by, but is\n<nowiki> </nowiki>not exclusively limited to a hostess. The style is very glamourous and \nfeminine, influenced by expressing a high level of sex appeal through \nthe style and attitude.\n\nThis is the style most often shown in the magazine \u5c0f\u60aa\u9b54 AGEHA \nmagazine, a popular magazine aimed at young women who love sexy and cute\n<nowiki> </nowiki>fashion, as well as those who work in the Hostess industry.\n\n=== Amekaji ===\n'''Amekaji''' is a bright, colourful fashion inspired by the ficitionised stereotypical idea of America in the 90's (with a lot of the Amekaji fashion giving off strong [[Americana]] vibes). The style is very comfortable and casual, and has been noted to \nbe particularly forgiving to Gyaru of all shapes and sizes as loose \nfitting clothing is appropriate.\n\n=== Ane Gyaru ===\n'''Ane Gyaru'''\u00a0is widely considered to \nbe the 'rebellious sister' of Oneegyaru. It is a mature style,similar to Onee, with its own twist. The style is associated with a \nrough attitude, and it is far more common to see tattoos and piercings \nin this style compared to many other gyaru styles. Because of the mature\n<nowiki> </nowiki>nature of the style, this sub-style is seen often on gyaru anywhere \nfrom early twenties to mid thirties.\n\n=== Banba ===\n'''Banba''' is a sub-style that developed from Manba. It is sometimes referred to as '[[Barbiecore|Barbie Style]]' or 'Barbie Manba' and is \nconsidered the toned down version of Manba.\n\nNeon colours are not really seen in this style and hair colours \ntend to be more toned down. Banba gyaru do have a tendency to wear a lot\n<nowiki> </nowiki>of glitter as part of their makeup but do not wear stickers on their \nface like Manba or Yamanba. Banba is a near-extinct sub style of gyaru, with a very small amount of Gyaru, primarily in japan, still wearing Banba.\n\n=== Bibinba ===\n'''Bibinba''' (\u30d3\u30d3\u30f3\u30d0) is an umbrella term for the Gyaru trend with similar \nfashion but includes a lot of gold, and jewelry,. It was largely a joke in Egg magazine about this style, and was not a serious style.\n\n=== Gaijin Gyaru ===\n'''Gaijin Gyaru''' is a term used for Gyaru which do not reside in \nJapan, or in some cases it is meant to mean a gyaru who is not of asian \ndescent.\n\n=== Ganguro ===\n'''Ganguro''' is a type of gyaru consisting of an artificial deep tan and bleached hair; and makeup which tended to use white around the eyes and on the lips and darker shades on the eyes. Also decorations such as glitter or flower such hibiscus flower stickers added on the under part of the eyes. This style was popular in the late 1990s and early 2000s.\n\n=== Ganjiro ===\n'''Ganjiro''' is a Japanese term specifically referring to any Gyaru who follows all of the other GAL trends, except tanning. They even go above and beyond to remain \"bihaku\" (beautifully white) and apply sun-block, though some ganjiro choose a light bronze skin tone, but they never tan religiously. This came about as a challenge to conventional Gyaru philosophy, namely that it's not the tan that makes you Gyaru, it's the attitude and way of carrying yourself, as well as the fashion you choose to wear. Ganjiro can still be any of the previous fashions other than Gonguro and Ganguro, some even slick on orange make-up and pretend to be Yamanba for a day.\n\n===Gyaru Den===\n'''Gyaru Den'''\u00a0is an attempt at reviving the Gyaru aesthetic through technology. It takes aspects of the gyaru fashion and then makes use of technology as a way to revamp the style; The creators of this style have created all of their items themselves; which can be as LED-lights or synthesizers which are used on accessories such as: necklaces, loose socks or different apparel pieces.\n\n=== Gyaru Mama ===\n'''Gyaru Mama''' is a type of gyaru consisting of teenage\u00a0gyaru\u00a0or women who \ncontinued with the style even after having children.\u00a0BBC News\u00a0states: \n\"Gal-mama are young mothers who refuse to shed their gal-ness.\"<sup>[11]</sup>\u00a0They\n<nowiki> </nowiki>also would clothe their children in the same style. Meaning a boy would\n<nowiki> </nowiki>look like a\u00a0gyaruo\u00a0while girls would look\u00a0gyaru\u00a0but the style would \ndepend on the mothers own personal choice of style or which subculture \nshe belonged to.\n\n=== Haaady Gyaru ===\nThe '''Haaady Gyaru''' is one of many popular Gyaru trends in 2007-2008.The \nterm \"Haaady\" (with 3 \"a\") was created by Egg magazine to designate the \nlook of her flagship model Kaoru Watanabe. The style \"Haaady\" is very \noften called \"Kaoru\" style \"or \"Cosmic\", \"Electric\" or \"Candy\" trend. \nThe word \"Haaady\" does not come from the English \"hard\" (it would not \nmake sense) but an exaggerated pronunciation of the Japanese word \"hade\"\n<nowiki> </nowiki>(\u6d3e \u624b) which means \"flashy\".\n\n===Himekaji===\n'''Himekaji''' (''also known as Hime Gyaru or Hime Kei'') is a sub-style of Gyaru. It is the casual alternative to Himegyaru and a style that requires less upkeep. The style itself is very similar to that of Roma Gyaru but has its own key differences, including more lace and pink being the most consistent colour used in co-ords.\u00a0 The style itself is often lumped together under the Himegyaru style, but it can be considered its own style. That being said, Himekaji is often worn by many Himegyaru on occasions they wish to go for a more casual and comfortable look.\n\n=== Kogyaru ===\n'''Kogal''' (''or\u00a0kogyaru'') is a Japanese fashion culture that involves \nschoolgirls wearing an outfit based on Japanese school uniform, but with\n<nowiki> </nowiki>very short skirts. The short skirts are worn irrespective of the \nseason. The girls may also wear loose socks and scarves, and have dyed \nhair.\n\n=== Manba ===\n'''Manba'''\u00a0is one of the many sub-styles of Gyaru. It is, alongside Yamanba, a style that developed from the original Ganguro style of gyaru. Manba is pretty much identical from Yamanba with a few small key differences. The most obvious difference is that where Yamanba wear white eyemakeup above their eye, Manba gyaru will wear white eye makeup both above and below. However the line between Yamanba and Manba gyaru is very blurred and the two styles coexist with one another as almost one.\n\n=== Mode ===\n'''Mode '''is a Japanese fashion trend that involves wearing simple \nblack and white clothing and/or accessories. This style is similar to \nKorean Fashion in many ways, the main one being its simplicity. Mode \nfashion can include very neutral light colours, or even animal prints \n(usually seen in handbags and hair accessories)\n\n=== Ora Ora Gyaru ===\n'''Ora Ora Gyaru'''\u00a0(Highly Active Style) or\u00a0'''Ora Ora Kei'''\u00a0is a sub-style of Gyaru fashion. The style is a tougher style of gyaru that focuses on black clothes, and being rebellious. Ora Ora can be seen in magazines such as Soul Sister, and Soul Japan. It sometimes includes yakuza-styled tattoos, and high brand accessories. Ora Ora Kei is a continuation of [[Yanki]] culture with the addition of Onii-kei gyaru styling.\n\n=== Rokku ===\nRokku is a substyle of Gyaru which borrows elements from Rock, [[Goth]], and [[Visual Kei]] aesthetics and is notable for being one of only a handful of Gyaru aesthetics that doesn't require one to tan (although piercings and tattoos are particularly popular in this circle).\n\n=== Romanba ===\n'''Romanba'''\u00a0was a short-lived sub-style of gyaru. It originates \nfrom the Manba style, with the 'Ro' standing for Romantic. Often \n(incorrectly) referred to as 'Lolita Gal', the only similarities this \nstyle holds with Lolita is the lace and accessories.\n\nThe style was invented by the egg model Ka-Tan and didn't really \ntake off in a big way like other styles, hence why the style is so short\n<nowiki> </nowiki>lived. Romanba can be considered a mesh of Himegyaru and Manba. The \nstyle has a huge feminine focus and features a lot of soft tones and \npink is usually the key colour, including the hair colour.\n\n=== Tsuyome ===\n'''Tsuyome''' is a style that contributed to the Gyaru subculture and is an offshoot of Ganguro.\n\n=== Yamanba ===\n'''Yamanba'''\u00a0(\u30e4\u30de\u30f3\u30d0) was a styles which developed from\u00a0Ganguro alongside Manba. Old school\u00a0yamanba\u00a0and\u00a0manba(particularly known as 2004 \nManba) featured dark tans and white lipstick, pastel eye makeup, tiny \nmetallic or glittery adhesives below the eyes, brightly coloured circle \nlenses, plastic dayglo-coloured clothing, and incongruous accessories, \nsuch as Hawaiian\u00a0leis. Stickers on the face died out shortly after 2004 \nand, for a while,\u00a0yamanba\u00a0died. Manba\u00a0then became more extreme, with multicoloured and usually \nsynthetic hair.\u00a0Manba\u00a0in 2008 saw a darker tan, and no facial stickers. \nHair was usually neon/bright colours, with pink being a favourite. Wool \nemulating dreadlocks, extensions, and clips were worn to make hair \nappear longer. Clothing remained the same, although\u00a0leis\u00a0were worn less \nfrequently.\n\n==Fashion==\nGyaru fashion is generally inspired by Western fashion, but there are several subgenres of Gyaru fashion.\n\n=== Agejo ===\n* Big, intricate hairstyles.
