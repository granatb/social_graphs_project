The Biker Aesthetic is not quite the bike itself, or anyone who rides one, but a specific type of style and attitude that is associated with it. The biker aesthetic is an image of toughness, roughness, sex appeal, and danger. \n\n== Origin ==\n\n\n\nThough motorcycles have been around since the 1800's (commercially, since the 1900's), the \u2018biker culture\u2019 as we know it now had its roots in post-world-war-II. With the men coming back from service, motorcycle advertising changed to reflect a masculine aesthetic, with women being pushes out of the picture, or included only as passengers for sex appeal. This push was part of the post-war movement for men to return to their prior \u2018masculine\u2019 roles, with women returning to their \u2018housewife\u2019 duties. \u00a0\n\n== Region ==\nAlthough the reach of the aesthetic has spread across the world, It's mainly associated with America, Japan, and Britain. The aesthetics vary by region, though all share common aesthetics, such as the tough and \u2018criminal\u2019 association.\n\n== Visuals ==\n\n* Leather jackets\n* Jacket patches (usually \u2018edgy\u2019 in nature)\n* Tattoos\n* Bandanas\n* Black\n* Bike helmets\n* jeans/ripped jeans\n* Leather vests\n* Beards\n* Finger-less gloves\n\n== Fashion ==\nBiker fashion changes culturally, but most incorporate leather, blacks and reds, studs, chains, jeans/denim, \u2018punk\u2019 styles, and \u2018edgy\u2019 styles. For women, there is usually an emphasis on sex appeal, while men emphasize masculinity and intimidation.\n\n== Music ==\nMetal, hard rock, and punk music is usually associated with bikers.\n\n== resources ==\n\n* https://www.encyclopedia.com/social-sciences/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/motorcycles-and-motorcycle-cultures\n* https://www.gq.com/gallery/the-evolution-of-motorcycle-style\n<gallery>\nFile:Alex-iby- ZagmOPlPCE-unsplash.jpg\nFile:Alex-iby-oqqEC31VT7I-unsplash.jpg\nFile:Allef-vinicius-0JuH3xmGZ4o-unsplash.jpg\nFile:Asdrubal-luna-5UsK71iAP1c-unsplash.jpg\nFile:Asdrubal-luna-w3woix46Nek-unsplash.jpg\nFile:Austin-neill-3vQmhZQpDiY-unsplash.jpg\nFile:Benjamin-suter-abx3A7d7CYE-unsplash.jpg\nFile:Billy-freeman-arlHo8Vg69o-unsplash.jpg\nFile:Bradley-dunn-omEIcPs WxU-unsplash.jpg\nFile:Damir-spanic-T2k6ntWAEKU-unsplash.jpg\nFile:Harley-davidson-QD6GvrDFPAA-unsplash.jpg\nFile:Spencer-davis-duXwICzzshc-unsplash.jpg\nFile:Harley-davidson-Sac6Ri0Lhrc-unsplash.jpg\nFile:Daniel-adesina-WlCNl0Ko5Ps-unsplash.jpg\nFile:Edewaa-foster-K6BViu7747w-unsplash.jpg\nFile:Edewaa-foster-gnjpa9eJQbE-unsplash.jpg\nFile:Edewaa-foster-1oY2OpM8FKU-unsplash.jpg\nFile:Elizeu-dias-Pfe3Ln-hpyU-unsplash.jpg\nFile:Erica-lewis-VbFNkcbgaGo-unsplash.jpg\nFile:Gabriel-aguirre-0vWY47Mh V4-unsplash.jpg\nFile:Harold-wainwright-sz8nF9Fo73g-unsplash.jpg\nFile:Henry-orr-0qmQVTEMdGo-unsplash.jpg\nFile:Henry-orr-QStVQcQIDDw-unsplash.jpg\nFile:Hua-ling-bZVxINhui k-unsplash.jpg\nFile:Imani-bahati-o9yT-NdVHcQ-unsplash.jpg\nFile:Jia-ye-COqQwsiMqMc-unsplash.jpg\nFile:Jingming-pan-ku6vi7gS-2g-unsplash.jpg\nFile:Jonathan-cosens-photography-VIYVg 5Es0o-unsplash.jpg\nFile:Mike-lloyd-hyyFzy1VNp4-unsplash.jpg\nFile:Mike-montgomery-H7UBlfVVHss-unsplash.jpg\nFile:Motoculturel-lX Walm1Bps-unsplash.jpg\nFile:Bosozoku motorcycle.jpg\nFile:220px-Kutte Motorrad vorn.jpg\nFile:Nick-fewings-6CkEdwHyGmo-unsplash.jpg\nFile:Oleg-yeltsov-8zKCsiPHcSA-unsplash.jpg\nFile:Petrebels-AR12trGJyjA-unsplash.jpg\nFile:Ricardo-arce-PvCX1T7DHhI-unsplash.jpg\nFile:Sean-delshadi-ox2VVRxENFs-unsplash.jpg\nFile:Sierra-koder-TdfB9aIjIk4-unsplash.jpg\nFile:Spencer-davis-duXwICzzshc-unsplash.jpg\nFile:Toa-heftiba-4UBh9FoYI7U-unsplash.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n\n\n<br />\n[[Category:Needs work]]"}}}]}}}}
