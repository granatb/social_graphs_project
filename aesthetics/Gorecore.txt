This aesthetic is similar to [[Devilcore]], [[Hatecore]], and [[Horror]].\n==Visual==\nVisually, Gorecore consists of blood, knives, organs, and other things that involve horror, death, and bodies. Common Gorecore images consist of children's drawings or things paired with blood and themes of death.\n\n==Fashion==\nGorecore fashion typically involves lots of red and black, possibly with a pop of another colour. \n\nHair done in a Gorecore style is often dyed two different colours, split down the middle. It also makes use of gore and knife-themed hair accessories, such as a headband that makes it look like the wearer has a knife going through their head.\n\nAccessories in Gorecore typically involve sharp imagery, such as spikes, studs, razor blades, and knives. They also may be reminiscent of blood and organs.\n\nGorecore clothing has punk, emo, and goth influences. \n\nSFX makeup is often used in Gorecore looks, to make it look like the wearer is bleeding, bruised, scarred, or otherwise injured. Red lipstick and eyeshadow is often utilized as well. Nails are often pointy and sharp.\n\n<br />\n<gallery widths=\"130\">\nAngry Young And Poor choker.jpg|A choker from Angry Young And Poor that has spikes and hanging razor blades.\nShein blood design choker.png|A blood choker from Shein.\nFile:Heart Coffin Knife Earring set.jpg|A earring set from Hot Topic That Includes Knifes, Hearts, and some blood drops.\n</gallery><br />\n\n==Music==\nGorecore music is mostly defined by the lyrics, which involve talk of bodies, flesh, meat, blood, and sometimes topics like murder and cannibalism.
