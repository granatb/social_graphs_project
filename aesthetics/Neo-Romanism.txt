A mixture of modern and classical.}}\n\n'''''Neo-Romanism''''' is an aesthetic influenced by '''''[[Bronzepunk]]''''', '''''[[Sandalpunk]]''''', '''''[[Neoclassicism]]''''', '''''[[Futurism]]''''' and '''''[[Renaissance]]''''', among others. It is also the judicial system that governs many 21st century democracies. \n\n'''''Neo-Romanism''''' began to boom with the popularization of neo-pagan religions such as Hellenism and the Roman Way at the end of the 20th Century, which have influenced its '''''\"romantic\"''''' vision of those times. \n\n== Antecedents ==\n'''''Neo-Romanism''''' has had many antecedents before it became what it was. Since the fall of the Roman Empire in 1453 many rulers have tried to rebuild or even consider themselves heirs of the Roman Empire. The most notorious example was Fascist Italy during World War II which unsuccessfully tried to rebuild a kind of Second Roman Empire. \n\nOn an artistic level, movements such as the '''''[[Renaissance]]''''' and '''''[[Neoclassicism]]'''''.\n\n== Differences with Bronzepunk and Sandalpunk ==\nIts great difference with these two aesthetics consists mainly in how they present technology, looks, architecture and culture. Since '''''Neo-Romanism''''' is much more attached to the present or Science Fiction, with influences from Greek and Roman culture, than a retro-futuristic vision of how those societies would have advanced. \n\n== Political projects ==\n'''Neo-Romanism''' has not only extended to art or judicial systems. It has also acquired political overtones, with projects such as the [[wikipedia:Nova Roma|'''''Nova Roma''''']] organization: an international organization of admirers of the culture of Ancient Rome, claiming to be a nation of modern Romans with the administrative structure modeled on the institutions of the Roman Republic. '''''Nova Roma''''' explicitly states that they are not a micronation, but a civitas or res publica. Their organization, however, fits all the requirements to be classified as such.\n\nAnother '''''Neo-Roman''''' micronation project that stands out ''(especially in the Spanish-speaking world)'' is the so-called [http://www.tiberia.tk/ '''''Republic of Tiberia'''''].\n\n== Values ==\nThe '''''Neo-Romans''''' call for a return to the classical values of ancient Rome and Greece, but without disregarding certain modern benefits. They simply consider that the excessive invidualism or collectivism of modern European societies of the 20th and 21st century has been more harmful than beneficial and is what has led these societies into a state of decadence. And to avoid a new Dark Age and for Humanity to prosper they must return to those values that once made them great. In this case, that of one of the most influential cultures, Ancient Rome.\n\n== Activities ==\nAmong the activities of '''''Neo-Romanism''''', the following stand out: \n\n* Admire important figures of the Ancient Ages and want to be like them.\n*Read literature from the Ancient Ages.\n*Recreation of activities carried out by ancient Romans, Greeks, Minoans, etc...\n* Participate in political or cultural projects, such as '''''Nova Roma'''''. \n* Being a follower or participant of neo-pagan religions of Greek or Roman origin. \n* Learn dead languages such as Latin or classical Greek.\n*Learning Philosophy \n*Learn Roman Law\n* Archive things of interest to you ''(using the Internet Archive, especially)'' for future preservation. Since all culture is valuable and influences in one way or another, in the improvement/perfection of that ''\"hypothetical\"'' Neo-Roman world.\n*Digital sculpting ''( using a notorious [[classicism]] influence)''\n*Walking through museums and galleries.\n* Various artistic activities. \n* Doing sport and staying healthy. Using the ancient Greek sportsmen as a reference.\n*Playing modernised versions of Ancient Age sports.\n*Rapping over [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsZic5DCRUk '''''Ancient Hip-Hop beats'''''] ''( Like a modernized version of the poetry recitals of ancient Rome and Greece )''\n\n== Music ==\nThe '''''Neo-Romanism''''' aesthetic has its own music, which is a sub-genre of '''''Bardcore''''', known as '''''Ancient Bardcore'''''. It recreates contemporary music in the style of the Ancient Ages.\n\n* ''[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbEKIW3pUUk '''Smells Like Teen Spirit - Nirvana ( Classical Latin cover )''']'' \n* ''[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU2fSB-lSB0 '''Demons - Imagine Dragons ( Ancient Greek Bardcore/Bronzecore )''']''\n* ''[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3ABntfFwc8 '''\"Anax\" ( Zombie - Cranberries Ancient Greek Bardcore/Bronzecore )''']''\n\nAlso, ''[[wikipedia:Low_Bap|'''Low Bap''']]'', a sub-genre of '''''[[Hip-Hop]]''''' that emerged in Greece, ''[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUyQ2rddBiw '''Greek Lo - Fi Hip - Hop'''] and'' ''[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnCjFZqSuPs '''Ancient Hip - Hop''']''  could be considered part of this aesthetic. \n\n== Fashion ==\n'''''Neo-Romanism''''' also reached the world of fashion. With companies such as Dolce Gabanna creating clothing collections inspired by the fashion of Byzantium (Eastern Roman Empire).\n\n== Art ==\nOn an artistic level, as is obvious beyond his influences of the '''''[[Renaissance]]''''', '''''[[Neoclassicism]]''''' and the classic world. On the Internet, the Neo-Roman art looks quite influenced by '''''[[Vaporwave]]''''' (particularly because of its use of works belonging to the  '''[[Renaissance]]''') and '''''[[Hustlewave]]''''' using the aesthetics of the first and the positivism of the second in order to encourage a return to the values and culture of Ancient Greece and Rome. In that aspect, it may also be reminiscent of how '''[[Fashwave]]''' and '''[[Sovietwave]]''' is used as propaganda.\n\n== Artists ==\n* '''''B. D. Foxmoor'''''\n* '''''Legends of the Ancients'''''\n* '''''Rafael Grasetti'''''\n* '''''the_miracle_aligner'''''\n*'''''La Bruja Muerta'''''\n*'''''Sadahzinia'''''\n\n== Neo-Romanism in sports ==\n'''Neo-Romanism''' has also reached the world of sports. With companies like the startup '''''Unified Weapons Master''''' wanting to ''\"resurrect\"'' gladiator fights, but in an modernized way. \n\n== Ideology ==\nAlthough it does not have a defined ideology, the ''[[wikipedia:Pan-Latinism|'''Pan - Latinism''']]'' ideology is considered part of the aesthetics and the movement, as it has influenced many of its members.\n\nLike the [https://polcompball.fandom.com/wiki/Anarcho-Frontierism '''''anarcho-frontierism'''''] and their aesthetics known as [[Space Cowboy|'''''Space Cowboy''''']].They support the idea of transhumanism, but with certain limits.\n\n== Media ==\n* '''''Warhammer 40k''''' (franchise)\n* '''''Roma Eterna''''' (book) \n* '''''Fallout: New Vegas''''' (videogame) <sub>(Legion ending)</sub>\n*'''''Fallout: Lanius''''' (live action fan film)\n*'''''Cyberpunk V3.0''''' (pen and paper RPG) <sub>(gangs like the Daughters of Hecate, Hippolyte and the Spartans)</sub>\n*'''''Nova Roma 2011''''' (short movie)\n*'''''Roma Nova''''' (books)\n*'''''Roman Justice SPQR: Too Roman To Handle''''' (book)\n*'''''Dune''''' (franchise) \n*'''''Stellaris''''' (videogame) \n*'''''Mythical Galaxy''''' (webcomic)\n*'''''Coriolanus''''' (2011 film, adaptation of Shakespeare play of the same name )\n*'''''Assasins Creed''''' ( franchise ) <sub>( Some parts of Isu technology and culture )</sub>\n*'''''Eclipse Phase'''''  (pen and paper RPG)\n*'''''Telefrag VR''''' (videogame)\n*'''''Well I Never Knew That! Did Romans Design the Space Shuttle?: The Roman Empire - Fascinating Facts and Everyday Phrases Explained'''''  (book)\n*'''''Foundation''''' ( 2021  Apple TV show adaption of the books of the same name )\n\n== Notes ==\n* There is a trope which influenced this aesthetic, [https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceRomans '''''Space Romans''''']. \n*The '''''Neo-Romans''''' have no problem with Christianity and other more recent religions. As a matter of fact, in Nova Roma there is freedom of worship, but it is true that many within this organisation/micronation have a certain repudiation of monotheistic religions, as they consider that in part, these caused the fall of empires such as the Roman Empire (both in its western and eastern part). Yet, they also consider Byzantium as part of their legacy and have been influenced (albeit to a lesser degree) by it.\n*Only some parts of Assasins Creed's Isu culture and technology could be considered part of this aesthetic, as the Isu are also influenced by '''''[[Bronzepunk]]''''' and '''''[[Sandalpunk]]'''''.\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery widths=\"185\">\nPan - latinism flag.png|Neo - Roman/Pan-Latinism flag\nTumblr acf3a118cb271b95caba9f921430dde8 54a71a80 1280.png\nDe31o8xr6qr01.jpg\nNova Roma claimed territories.png|Territories claimed by Nova Roma (circa 2011)\nActual roman soldier.jpg\n0h6rg50pawf61.jpg\nGracjan-krawczyk-rome-3.jpg\n73da8f473a980470525854bda944ab5a.jpg\nDcf0lqn-1918849e-06b5-4aa2-b486-b4d2f390ec05.png\nD4c4opz-41a1b20f-70fc-4c78-b1e3-d8c4f7e7b6db.png\n7768920694 0b5c72da8a b.jpg\nRpub6wn1vxm21.jpg\nActual roman soldier 2.jpg\nThe emperor s ambition by alexweston45 degvis2-fullview.jpg\nFuturistic ancient roman.jpg\nAncient future.jpg\nDc143dj-f496c23f-a950-4e24-8e6f-99c19a3fd55c.jpg\nGladius-and-shield-vs-krabi-970x0.jpg|Modern gladiators fighting\n14279411734 1594192f29 z.jpg\nMarcus-oriente-spartacusfinal.jpg\nACV - Asgard.webp|Asgard in Assasins Creed : Valhalla, a good example of Neo-Roman architecture.\nACV Asgard Roman Gate 3.webp\nFuturistic Rome.jpg\nRoman astronaut.jpg\nSpace Roman Empire.jpg\nMax-bedulenko-greek-1.jpg|Futuristic Byzantium\nSteamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net.jpg\nD2d17c0f6b1f0d48c985ccd40157dc17.jpg\nTank.jpg\n1432856753698.jpg\nAmanda-castrillo-empress-final.jpg\nDdnprbp-0043a0a6-86e8-4f5a-be10-b8de7a5b9bba.jpg\n1528798866455.jpg\n5xiiwg2eju561.jpg\nCyborg gladiators.jpg\n6786a5eb0f746e94d3bc731105d30b1b.png\nPolizia.png\nFuturistic Gladiator Arena.jpg|Modern Gladiator Arena\nLady Justice.jpg|Lady Justice (digital sculpture by Rafael Grassetti)\n1626598729483.jpeg|Neo - Romanism Internet Art\n1626770777057.jpeg\n1628422995384.jpg\nMemes-in-english-i-sleep-memes-in-latin-es-adverisne-37558873.png\nPan - Latinism Meme.jpg|Pan - Latinism Meme\n91136596 653149565473980 3230237627647000576 n-720x715-195000376.jpg\nKdndr30nffl11.webp\nFile:1629920400117.jpg\nFile:Foundation de Isaac Asimov .jpg\nFile:C0cdjxudjde41.jpg\nFile:9d375cc1e359fa36fbe87233752bdc46.jpg\nFile:5d1a0a56a2642b03fcc6df67502a42d0--roman-fashion-modern-fashion.jpg\nFile:658dc14107ff53ba81a131541f640244.jpg\nFile:Linus-goh-emperor-of-mankind.jpg\nFile:Dune.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n== Sources ==\n* ''[https://www.zmescience.com/other/feature-post/modern-gladiator-competition/ '''Company wants to ressurect gladiators - with a modern twist''']''\n*''[http://www.novaroma.org/nr/Main_Page '''Nova Roma website''']''\n*[http://www.tiberia.tk/ '''''Republic of Tiberia website''''']\n*''[https://pureplaystation.com/telefrag-vr-announced-for-psvr-set-in-a-futuristic-roman-empire-with-guns/2019/05/ '''Telefrag VR Announced for PSVR, Set in a Futuristic Roman Empire With Guns''']''\n\n[[Category:Visual]]\n[[Category:Fashion]]\n[[Category:Written]]\n[[Category:Music]]\n[[Category:Ism suffix]]\n[[Category:Space]]"}}}]}}}}
