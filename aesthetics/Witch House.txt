It often (but not always) fits into the electronic sub-genre, and/or has themes that are dark and revolve around the occult, the supernatural, and horror.\n\n==Visuals==\nWhile Witch House definitely revolves more around music, it has been visually interpreted, taking a lot of cues from the [[Vaporwave]] school of aesthetic thought. It has been interpreted in three ways, which have sometimes been known to merge:\n\n*Revolving around more tech-y visuals with dark undertones.\n*Revolving around more actual witchcraft, in the sense of Pagan magick and/or Wicca.\n*Revolving heavily around the dark aspect, often using imagery that may be found in horror.\n\nWhile there is a lot of crossover with the [[Witchcore]] aesthetic, make no mistake: Witchcore takes more of a nature-based approached compared to the more dark tech-y Witch House aesthetic, which can also invoke [[Devilcore|Satanic]] imagery on top of everything.\n\n==Fashion==\nWitch House fashion can draw upon a lot of [[Goth]], [[Urbancore|Streetwear]], [[Techwear]], and Vaporwave fashions (although in the case of the Vaporwave inspirations, it's done less in the bright colors often associated with it and instead uses more of a monochromatic color palette with hints of red mixed in).  Witch House fashion can also draw upon a lot of 90s [[Grunge]] and [[Mallgoth]] fashion choices as well\n\n==Music==\nMusically, Witch House has a droning, dark, and gothic sound to it that's designed to evoke a gothic atmosphere that works surprisingly well with the House music format.\n\n*[http://humanfobia-official.bandcamp.com/ Humanfobia]\n*[https://dzzlingmliciousdazzlingmalicious.bandcamp.com/ DAZZLING MALICIOUS]\n*[https://reberhead.bandcamp.com/ Reberhead]\n*[https://powwoww.bandcamp.com/ powwoww]\n*[https://modernwitch.bandcamp.com/ Modern Witch]\n*[https://sidewalksandskeletons.bandcamp.com/ Sidewalks & Skeletons]\n*[https://crystalcastles.bandcamp.com/ Crystal Castles]\n*[http://s4lem.com/ S4LEM]\n*[https://whitering.bandcamp.com/ White Ring]\n*[https://blvckceiling.bandcamp.com/ BLVCK CEILING]\n*[https://blckct.bandcamp.com/ BLVCK CAT]\n*[https://scowitchboy.bandcamp.com/ \u25b3Sco\u25b3]\n*[https://fixions.bandcamp.com/ Fixions]\n*[https://purityringthing.com purity ring]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/artist/3luonLzvSOxdU8ytCaEIK8?si=u10hwA2FSxChSRRslIu0JA IC3PEAK]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/artist/00ulCGnhqJjWT6oL9JZEgm Lightex]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/artist/2Md4qykZwbsTbHF3MD183Z Ritualz]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/artist/3jIi2szsFwzmJCtETr5SaH \u2206AIMON]\n\n[[File:HOW TO MAKE WITCH HOUSE|thumb|330x330px]]\n\n===Spotify playlists===\n\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/357Jg4nPfDrxbD7XdXN7Bk?si=sABd77pdRrSqT4ZCgn--dg Witch House Spotify playlist by Sidewalks and Skeletons]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/22jV8DlAdlWUeOYtOcIHPF?si=qaJjex_TRfGStFGnjFsX5g \u25b2 \u2020 WITCH HOUSE \u2020 \u25b2 Spotify playlist by eradiel]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6DY9zABKqtpM5HyyzmYAPr?si=I_wuGls7RdKYQqLUCPEkAA \u271e\u25b2\u271e Witch House \u271e\u25b2\u271e Spotify playlist by Lee Coxon]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7LBFMuT8Ool5VxAbDMWjtA?si=2b6RAEtJSi6gTxXwqR4utA Witch House Nights Official Spotify Playlist]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2Y0f5Px637BKx8QwsEyZKF?si=aKVhLVq7R9im380T1kvCDg Witch House Spotify playlist by Walther Anger]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1VFUjPPXgCK5u4p75W9eKV?si=658t8XxVSdGhYRdOlhkHXg WITCH HOUSE Spotify playlist by MrSuicideSheep]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0qRB6EMArr8xLzHOK7th7o?si=Fv8dqv6XTiSz3BoJOLx2qw The Sound of Witch House Spotify playlist by The Sounds of Spotify]\n**[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/74AAc833ETVO0mcrd33LBs?si=C6YP_mzWQTGm5iVY6Hsubw Intro to Witch House]\n**[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4SteY8CMCJkfmXionM1YEI?si=H2nMtg5jR0aaZ-NlQg_ggw The Pulse of Witch House]\n**[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/28SAfvF70fSoYmz7dNkAI3?si=jPweVLZGQ2yQ-TGtD7-kQw The Edge of Witch House]\n**[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7qHHCGApHvetjwqBrNIEwZ?si=FxB-kCF4TRSR5PV7faebqw A \u2640Filter for Witch House]\n\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4Y0FjlVEMRgZhRpJ4KDEj5?si=iwKRcAvmRXCl6uRTxEHEtg Russian Witch House Spotify playlist by camrackam]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4ZB4AMi47OEnZRnJeM4I93?si=1GxQOW6HSyy_UOv61_vreA Witch House Spotify playlist by Victor Herrera]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5AgcemPPaDXSOJmykxx8uT?si=c71ec6411b7e4561 \ud83c\udfae Gaming Dark Night \ud83c\udfae by Gaby Sena]\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"130\" spacing=\"small\">\nMaxresdefaultwitchhouse2.jpg\nMaxresdefaultwitchhouse.jpg\nClams-casino-live-netherlands.jpg\nRitualz 1 437 384 int.png\n5080a914274af9b97fc265ef8ef2fcda.gif\nTeens-drugs-and-hiv-jokes-welcome-to-witch-house-in-russia-body-image-1434527870.webp\n815147939471165.jpg\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Music]]\n[[Category:Visual]]\n[[Category:Needs work]]"}}}]}}}}
