It's meant to draw you into a time before and forget about the current things happening, back into a time where everything felt simpler. It's important to note, however, that this time period was riddled with bigotry, and not actually as idyllic as the media of the time presents.  \n\n== History ==\nThe Old Hollywood period was the beginning of the Sound Era: when silent movies faded out of the spotlight as we transitioned to sound-film production. The beginning of the Sound Era isn't exactly set in concrete. Some think of it as when the movie ''The Jazz Singer'' was released in 1927, which was the first full movie with synchronized dialogue (though I don't recommend watching it because it's highkey racist), while some see it as 1929, the official end of the Silent Era. \n\nOld Hollywood movies adhered to strict set of genres: Western, comedic, musical, and biography, sometimes multiple at once. The movies have linear timelines that leave no room for speculation, except when a character has a flashback, and the problems are always solved at the end (one of the reasons people are drawn to this aesthetic). \n\n== Fashion ==\n\n=== Clothing ===\nFashion from the old Hollywood days include:\n\n* Midi length dresses, large collars, puff sleeves, belted waists\n* A long evening gown, backless, deep cut, sleeveless\n* High waisted sailor pants\n* Slouch hats, tilt hats, knit berets\n*Pillbox hats\n* Fur boas and jackets\n* Oxford Shoes\n* T-strap and Mary Jane heels\n*Kitten heels\n* Pearl earrings\n* Small handbags\n* Opera gloves\n\nMakeup was minimal but bold, dark lips and thin eyebrows were popular.\n\n\n\nYou can get pieces like these from vintage/thrift stores, there are also lots of sewing patterns on Etsy.\n\n=== Hair ===\n\n* Lots of waves\n* Shorter hair is ideal, but you can still have lots of hair-do's with longer hair.\n* Classic finger curls are an amazing look.\n* You can find lots of inspiration from actors at the time.\n\n== Notable Figures ==\n\n=== 1930s ===\n\n* Greta Garbo\n* Rudolph Valentino\n* Colleen Moore\n* Norma Shearer\n* John Barrymore\n* Lon Chaney, Sr.\n* Joan Crawford\n* Gloria Swanson\n\n* Ginger Rogers\n* Barbara Stanwyck\n* Fred Astaire\n* Vivien Leigh\n* Errol Flynn\n* Clark Gable\n* Shirley Temple\n* Olivia de Havilland\n* Judy Garland\n* Jean Harlow\n* Fay Wray\n* Marlene Dietrich\n* Bette Davis\n* Katherine Hepburn\n* Mickey Rooney\n\n=== 1940s ===\n\n* James Stewart\n* Lauren Bacall\n* Laurence Olivier\n* Cary Grant\n* Humphrey Bogart\n* Veronica Lake\n* Ava Gardner\n* Henry Fonda\n* Lana Turner\n* Gary Cooper\n* Rita Hayworth\n*Gene Tierney\n* Hedy Lamar\n* Bob Hope\n* Ingrid Bergman\n* Bing Crosby\n* Robert Mitchum\n* Burt Lancaster\n* William Holden\n* John Wayne\n\n=== 1950s ===\n\n* Elizabeth Taylor\n* Marilyn Monroe\n* Elvis Presley\n* Grace Kelly\n* Marlon Brando\n* Rock Hudson\n* Dorothy Dandridge  \n* Ruby Dee\n* Audrey Hepburn\n* James Dean\n* Shirley MacLaine\n* Debbie Reynolds\n* Lucille Ball\n* Jeanne Crain\n* Sophia Loren\n* Natalie Wood\n* Charlton Heston\n\n== Film ==\nHere are some of the classic movies from this time period.\n\n* ''The Wizard of Oz (1939)''\n\n* ''Gone with the Wind (1939)''\n\n* ''King Kong (1933)''\n\n* ''The Adventures of Robin Hood (1938)''\n\n* ''Frankenstein (1931)''\n\n* ''Dracula (1931)''\n\n* ''Snow White (1937)''\n\n* ''Singin' in the Rain (1952)''\n\nThere are also many later movies, set in or pay homage to the era:\n\n* ''Sunset Boulevard (1951)''\n* ''Cats Don't Dance (1997)''\n* ''Silent Movie (1976)''\n* ''Singin' In The Rain (1952)''\n* ''The Artist (2011)'' \n*''Myra Breckinridge (1970)''\n\n== TV Shows ==\n-''Hollywood'', Ryan Murphy (2020) <small>(about a group of aspiring actors and filmmakers during the Hollywood Golden Age in the post-World War II era)</small>\n\n== Music ==\n''Under Construction''\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery widths=\"177\">\n1930s Lady.jpg\nEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE.jpg\nRosemary-clooney-love-white-christmas-dark-dress.jpg\nOld holywood 8.jpg\nBlack and white (5).jpg\nMonroe maralin.jpg\nBlack and white movi3.jpg\nPicture perfect.jpg\nBehind the scenes 6.jpg\nSmile for the camera.jpeg\nWray, Fay 01.jpeg|Canadian actress Fay Wray|link=Old Hollywood\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Needs work]]\n[[Category:Visual]]\n[[Category:Fashion]]\n[[Category:Music]]"}}}]}}}}
