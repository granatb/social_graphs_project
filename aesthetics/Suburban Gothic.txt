Common motifs include coming-of-age, familial/generational trauma, facades, and the shallowness of capitalistic culture. The motifs and photographs are American-centric, with parodies and dark interpretations of the 1950s nuclear family and 1980s economic boom. There is a heavy emphasis on the use of [[Liminal Space]], supernatural beings, and tropes typically found in suburban culture, such as housewives and cheerleaders. Those characters and locations tend to have a dark secret, such as drug addiction or infidelity to emphasize the darker nature of the restrictiveness of social norms.  \n\nWhile sharing similar traits with [[Southern Gothic]] and [[Midwest Gothic]], there is no specific region or nation that appears prominently in suburban gothic. The aesthetic has its origins in literature, film, and television, but later gained a visual aesthetic and more examples through short bullet-pointed lists with the regional gothic trend on Tumblr in the mid-2010s.\n\n<br />\n\n== Visuals ==\n\n* Animals that evoke the supernatural, such as black dogs or deer\n* Beings/items that seem misplaced in the setting\n* Convenience stores\n* Drug addiction\n* Empty diners\n* Fog\n* Ghosts, especially sheeted\n* Graffiti\n* Grocery stores\n* Laundromats\n* Lights that are an unusual color, such as red or blue\n* Malls\n* Playgrounds\n* Roads and highways\n* Run-down cars\n* Street lamps\n* Suburban neighborhoods at night\n* Traumacore style edits of depressing messages layered over images\n* Technology from the 60s-80s, such as box TVs and telephones\n\n<br />\n\n== Media ==\nFor more, see the [https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuburbanGothic TVTropes page]. \n\n=== Books ===\n\n* ''White Noise'' by Don DeLillio\n*''Such a Quiet Place'' by Megan Miranda <br />\n\n=== Movies ===\n\n*''American Beauty'' (1999)\n*''Beetlejuice'' (1988)\n* ''Blue Velvet'' (1986)\n*''Carrie'' (1976)\n*''Edward Scissorhands'' (1990)\n*''Gone Girl'' (2014)\n*''Heathers'' (1988)\n*''Jennifer's Body'' (2009)\n*''Super Dark Times'' (2017)\n*''The Burbs'' (1989)\n*''The Nightmare on Elm Street'' (1984)\n* ''The Stepford Wives'' (1975)\n* ''The Virgin Suicides'' (1999)\n\n<br />\n\n=== Podcasts ===\n\n* ''Welcome to Nightvale''\n\n<br />\n=== TV Shows ===\n\n*''Dead to Me'' (2019-)\n*''Pretty Little Liars'' (2010-2017)\n*''Sharp Objects'' (2018)\n*''Stranger Things'' (2016-)\n*''The Addams Family'' (1964-1966)\n*''The Twilight Zone'' (specifically episodes centering around suburbia, such as \"The Monsters are Due on Maple Street\")\n*''Twin Peaks'' (1990-1991)\n*''Why Women Kill'' (2019-)\n\n== Music ==\n\n=== Albums ===\n\n*''Inbred'' by Ethel Cain\n*''The Suburbs'' by Arcade Fire\n*''Neon Bible'' by Arcade Fire\n* ''Pure Heroine'' by Lorde\n*''The Normal Album'' by Will Wood\n*''Punisher'' by Phoebe Bridgers \n*''Please'' by Pet Shop Boys\n\n<br />\n=== Playlists ===\n[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1wiyFN25CrdZuAtlo4bdQq?si=TUmk6CdrT0KUohpDuAUFCQ my life as a dark indie coming of age film]\n\n[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7K1eNy0Nc5fsRVbCi1yb8H Strangerhood]\n\n[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0gkwJ8vE2ZN6GReH5zxC1k?si=YXiapdOlQXaWoAfK3KrCRA suburban gothic]\n\n[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0V4ZM0YcrX7c5RJy4e0Cd7?si=5IZ0cmXNT-2pFI7X63f3jw suburban haze]\n\n[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5Y77QQtVChkY2OSR3xtRTn?si=3a0f32ac7d8543ec american suburbia but something isn't quite right]\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\n\nFile:Ghost sign.jpg\nFile:Stack of tv for suburban gothic.jpg\nFile:Goth couple.jpg\nFile:Empty grocery store.png\nFile:Edit by spacemancharisma on tumblr.png\nFile:Art by wwasteland on tumblr.jpg\nFile:Freeway sign.jpg\nFile:Suburban gothic quote by petalsforarmor2020.jpg\nFile:Suburban gothic house.jpg\nFile:Suburban gothic church.jpg\nFile:Suburban gothic diner.jpg\nFile:Suburban gothic run.jpg\n\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Needs work]]\n[[Category:Visual]]\n[[Category:Architecture]]\n[[Category:Goth Suffix]]\n[[Category:Suburbia]]\n[[Category:Creepy]]"}}}]}}}}
