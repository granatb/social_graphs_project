It is unusual with the Academia aesthetic genre as it is not as subdued in colour. \n\n\n\nVibrant academia focuses on the joy of learning and the pursuit of knowledge out of curiosity. There is a particular focus on mental health, wellness, and taking care of your mind that is not typically present in other academic aesthetic. It encourages open and frank discussions of serious mental health disorders and tries to break down stigma.\n\nThere is also an element of teaching and the enjoyment of passing on your knowledge as well as increasing it through study. Think of your batty science professor, nutty art teacher, kooky literature lecturer. \n\nClothing involves the traditional academia motifs, vintage styles (the 50s lends itself well to this subtype due to the more vibrant colouring) waistcoats, berets, tweed, shirts and blouses, cardigans (bonus points for elbow pads), but in brighter hues. There is a love for big, kitschy costume jewellery.\n\nAreas of study can include many topics but literature, art, and psychology as well as other sciences are particular themes.\n\nVibrant Academia intentionally celebrates all learning and all academics, regardless of subject, grades, degree level, educational institute, or background (including class, race, sex, (dis)ability, religion, gender and gender identity, sexuality, etc.). <br />\n\n== Inspirations ==\n\n=== Pinterest Boards ===\n\n* [https://cz.pinterest.com/art_by_nerea/vibrant-academia/ Vibrant Academia by Art_by_Nerea]\n*[https://pin.it/6UgBJFC Bright Academia Aesthetic by TeacupGalaxy]\n\n=== Books ===\n\n*''Howl's Moving Castle'' by Diane Wynn Jones\n*''Harry Potter series'' by J.K.

Not all need to be full rainbow, but it is encouraged. Fruit motifs are often a theme, particularly apples, as well as polka dots and stripes. Fashion usually resolves around early to mid-20th European/American school or prep style but like in Pastel Academia there is K-Fashion and J-Fashion influences.\n\n==== Accessories ====\n\n* Berets\n* Knee-high socks\n* Brooches\n* Satchels\n* Glasses\n* Scarves\n* Bows\n* Alice bands\n* Brightly-coloured tights\n*Bowties\n*Boater hats\n*\n\n<br />\n==== Clothing ====\n\n* Chunky knits\n* Blazers\n* Pussy-bow blouses\n* Shirts\n* Tweed and plaid (but bright hues)\n* Cardigans\n* Swing or pencil skirts\n* Culottes\n* Dress pants/trousers\n*Waistcosts/vests\n\n<br />\n==== Shoes ====\n\n* Oxfords\n* Mary Janes\n*Loafers\n*Court shoes\n*Brogues\n\n<br />\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery widths=\"185\">\n\nVibrant academia Rainbow books A-Z.jpg\nVibrant academia reading.jpg\nPencil outfit Vibrant Academia.jpg\nBook dress.jpg\nvibrant academiamoodboard.png\n@ eydeirrac.jpg\nCrayons.gif\nBubblegum.jpg\nVibrant Academia rainbow book dress in London phone box mini library.jpg\nAlex\u2642.jpg\nBy michelle.jpg\nBy \ud835\udcb3\ud835\udcaa\ud835\udcb3\ud835\udcaa, \ud835\udc9f\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udcc1\ud835\udcc1 \ud835\udc35\ud835\udcb6\ud835\udcb7\ud835\udcce \u2764\ufe0e.jpg\nSelf worth.jpg\nLots of crayons.jpg\nCat in bookshelf.jpg\nRainbow pens.jpg\nRainbow highlighters.jpg\nCrayon-2162075 340.webp\nHappy.webp\nMirroring-2371854 340.webp\nGreen-1738220 340.webp\nStrawberry-beret.jpg\n\n</gallery><br />\n\n[[Category:Needs work]]\n[[Category:Academia]]\n[[Category:Visual]]\n[[Category:Fashion]]\n[[Category:Created Aesthetic]]\n[[Category:Feminine]]\n[[Category:Youthful]]\n[[Category:Cute]]"}}}]}}}}
