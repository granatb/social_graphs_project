De Stijl consisted of artists and architects. In a narrower sense, the term De Stijl is used to refer to a body of work from 1917 to 1931 founded in the Netherlands. Proponents of De Stijl advocated pure abstraction and universality by a reduction to the essentials of form and colour; they simplified visual compositions to vertical and horizontal, using only black, white and primary colors.\n\n\n\n\n\n== Motivation ==\nIn Mondrian's opinion, only abstract art can show the harmony behind what's visible. \n\nIn the year this art movements was founded, there was still a war going on. With De Stijl, people longed for a world of inner peace, harmon,y and order, instead of the everyday chaos. \n\n== Artwork ==\nArtists wanted to break the age-old tradition of art needing a clear presentation. They did not want to paint what was in front of them, for example a landscape, but they wanted to paint their feelings and thoughts.<ref>Explanation from Malevich</ref> And for them, that was best done by extreme simplicity and abstraction. They also argued that while a realistic painting shows reality, it does not show the truth.<ref>Brancusi's argument</ref>\n\n== Architecture ==\n{{Infobox_album|title = Rietveld-Shr\u00f6derhuis|image = Bro.jpg|imagecaption = Interior|artist = Rietveld|released = 1924}}Architects wanted to \"start from zero\" with this movement, to break away from designing 'old-fashioned' houses. \n\nFeatures of De Stijl in architecture:\n* Open structure\n* Use of horizontal and vertical forms\n* No decoration\n* Sliding walls\n* No clear room lay-out\n* No thought for privacy\n\n== Fashion ==\n''Under Construction''\n\n== Notable artists ==\n* [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piet_Mondrian Mondrian]\n* [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazimir_Malevich Malevich]\n* [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantin_Br%C3%A2ncu%C8%99i Brancusi]\n* [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerrit_Rietveld Rietveld]\n* [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcel_Breuer Breuer]\n* [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Brinkman Brinkman]\n* [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leendert_van_der_Vlugt Van der Vlugt]\n\n== Gallery ==\n''Under Construction''\n\n== References ==\n* \"Bespiegeling\" (art book for school) written by J.
