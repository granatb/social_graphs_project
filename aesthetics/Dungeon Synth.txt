The genre employs aesthetics and themes typically associated with black metal and applies it to dreamier ambient songs.\n\n\n\n== Visual ==\nDungeon Synth uses many aspects of black metal in its visuals. A lot of the members of the genre use corpsepaint and dress in medieval clothes. The album artwork also uses medieval-style paintings.\n\n== Music ==\n[https://youtu.be/7F_xOzLWy5U Deja Vu - Mort Garson], most popularly known as the theme to The Adventure Zone, a podcast created by the McElroy family following their D&D campaign. This song is an example of Dungeon Synth because of its combination of fantasy-esc (high wandering melody, like what you would hear on the soundtrack of a fantasy movie, emphasized by its use in a D&D podcast) and rock elements (good baseline, synth instruments).  \n\n[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChmm356a5qe1luUsoatAgjA The Dungeon Synth Archives - YouTube], A YouTube channel dedicated to reposting Dungeon Synth gems.  \n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery widths=\"185\">\n81Y8xqj63eL.
