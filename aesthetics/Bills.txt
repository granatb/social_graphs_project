They wore cowboy hats that were brown and had cowboy boots.\u00a0They were particularly drawn to Western movies, and \"Billism\" began to incorporate many of the motifs into their lives. The portrayal of\u00a0Buffalo Bill\u00a0in the movies was especially appealing partly because of the similarity to hunter heroes of\u00a0Congolese culture. The character of Buffalo Bill had already appeared in over 20 films by that time, but the most influential movie is thought to be\u00a0Pony Express, where\u00a0Charlton Heston played Bill.\n\n\n[[Category:Fashion]]\n[[Category:Movies]]\n[[Category:African]]\n[[Category:Needs work]]\n[[Category:Masculine]]\n[[Category:Candidates for Deletion]]"}}}]}}}}
