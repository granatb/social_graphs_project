It originated in works by 19th-20th century Southern authors criticizing their society's racism, sexism, classism, fixation on the past, and decaying economy. Later the aesthetic deviated from literature with the \"regional gothic\" trend on tumblr in the mid-2010s, which places greater emphasis on [[Liminal Space]], modern American iconography, evangelicalism, and controversially, hillbilly horror. Because of this, this entry is divided into two sections, with one based on the literary movement and the other on the tumblr revival. \n\n{{Aesthetic\n|title1=Southern Gothic (Regional/Modern)\n|image1= [[File:tcm.jpg|thumb|180px]]\n|caption1= A screen cap from Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2\n|other_names=\n|decade_of_origin=2010s\n|key_motifs=Isolation, religious guilt, the uncanny\n|related_aesthetics=[[After Hours]]<br>[[Anglo Gothic]]<br>[[Coffinwood]]<br>[[Midwest Gothic]]<br>[[Regional Gothic]]<br>[[Suburban Gothic]]\n|related_media=Texas Chainsaw Massacre\n|key_colours=black, brown, green, red, white}}\n==Visuals ==\n\n\n\n\n===Literary===\nThe visuals of the literary movement connect with the gothic imagery of decay as a metaphor for the fall of society due to lack of progress. Imagery tended to emphasize the political themes of the work and highlight the differences between the plantation class, poor white people, and black people.\n\n*American Civil War imagery\n*Daguerreotypes\n*Ghosts and other supernatural beings\n*Plantation houses in states of decay\n*Southern Belle-style dresses\n\n<br />\n=== Regional Gothic ===\n\n* Abandoned gas stations\n* Animals with cultish undertones, such as deer and rams\n* Bayous and swamps\n* Billboards with evangelical messages meant to inspire fear in the reader\n* Grotesque looking people. This is controversial due to the classism and fatphobia inherent in deeming Southerners \"ugly and creepy\"\n* Women in white dresses (not necessarily 19th century) resembling ghosts\n*Supernatural and ritualistic objects such as Ouija boards and candles\n* Voodoo\n\n\n==Media (Literary)==\nPlease note, a [https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SouthernGothic TVTropes page] exists for the aesthetic, as well as it being a genre that is much observed and compiled. \n\n=== Books, Anthologies, and Short Stories ===\n\n* ''Absalom, Absalom!'' by William Faulkner\n* ''A Good Man is Hard to Find and Other Stories'' by Flannery O'Connor\n* ''As I Lay Dying'' by William Faulkner\n* ''Everything That Rises Must Converge'' by Flannery O'Connor\n* ''Light in August'' by William Faulkner\n* \"The Gold-Bug\" by Edgar Allan Poe\n* ''The Sound and the Fury'' by William Faulkner\n* ''The Violent Bear it Away'' by Flannery O'Connor\n* ''Wise Blood'' by Flannery O'Connor\n*The Raven Boys series by Maggie Stiefvater\n*''Tennyson'' by Lesley M.M.

Instrumentation tends to be acoustic, except electric guitar, and either in a slower tempo due to the singers' lower pitch and mournful theme, or in a rapid, scat-like approach to singing that is typically in more rock-like and rebellious songs. \n\nThe lyrics address the common motifs of Southern Gothic: poverty, religion, drug addiction, the supernatural, and death. They often utilize tropes within novels and folktales, such as making deals with the Devil at the crossroads, witch trials, mothers mourning the death of their children, and becoming a killer. \n\nIn playlists, there are exceptions, and multiple songs that carry across either an abandoned or a sublime, witch-like sound that do not suggest the American South are also popular. \n\n=== Artists ===\n\n* Black Rebel Motorcycle Club\n* Blues Sacareno\n* The Brothers Bright\n* The Dead Weather\n* Fire on Fire\n* Johnny Cash\n* Rising Appalachia\n*Robert Johnson\n\n=== Playlists ===\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPtD2znexvd2eabCPTSCpo-A2r8fvxk5f\n\n<br />\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery widths=\"185\">\nSouthern Gothic Woman.jpg\nScreen Shot 2021-01-11 at 1.13.13 PM.png\n0a77f05b-c0ad-479d-a9c0-a69e35f21f0a-abandoned-homes-america-dicksonia-plantation-alabama-3.jpg\nAshley-knedler-108482-unsplash.jpg\nSg church.jpg\nSg graves.jpg\nSg house.jpg\nSg sign.jpg\nSg water.jpg\n90.jpg\n9qutakjn9jy51.jpg\nSwamp.jpg\nWhispering-in-the-cypresses-house.jpg\n8029f7a54e40fa2329f0b5d2dc6b9489.jpg\n</gallery><gallery>\n\n\n\n</gallery><gallery>\n</gallery>\n\n[[Category:Needs work]]\n[[Category:Visual]]\n[[Category:Goth Suffix]]\n[[Category:Creepy]]"}}}]}}}}
