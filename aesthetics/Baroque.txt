It was later also applied to art, fashion, and architecture of the period, but eventually lost its pejorative tone. \n\nThough relatively minor, the 20th and 21st centuries have seen a renewed and prolonged interest in Baroque music, art, and motifs. Famously, Dolce and Gabbana's 2012 collection of Baroque-inspired clothing confirmed a subtle, decades-long trend: a comeback for some of the Baroque era's most recognizable patterns and colors.  \n\n== History ==\n<br />\n\n== Notable Artists ==\n\n* Artemisia Gentileschi\n* Caravaggio\n* Rembrandt\n\n== Visual ==\nThe Baroque artistic movement is characterized by its melodramatic tableaus, lavish ornamentation, use of deep colors, [[Chiaroscuro]], and asymmetry. The paintings most commonly depict scenes from the Bible or Greek mythology and portraits of nobility.  \n\nCommon visuals include:\n\n* Landscapes\n\n* Flowers\n* Religious figures (saints, angels, demons, etc.)\n* Mythical creatures \n* Ancient Greek and Roman characters\n*Celestial bodies (planets, constellations, sun/moon, etc.)\n* Painted ceilings\n*Candles\n* Musical instruments \n* Memento mori\n* Masquerade balls\n* Fountains\n* Castles\n* Large, grand churches\n* Ornate palaces\n*Opera houses\n* Pastoral scenes (flower baskets, shepherds, lovers in the woods, etc.)\n* Banquets\n\nFashion:\n\n* Statement jewelry with large gemstones\n* Crowns\n* Long, trailing dresses\n* Ballroom gowns\n* Lace\n*Ribbons\n* Flowing capes\n* Ornate/patterned coats and blazers\n* Gold filigree jewelry\n*Tassels\n* Brocade trimming\n* Pointed toe heels\n\nPatterns, fabrics and materials:\n\n* Jacquard\n* Damask\n* Checkered\n* Toile de Jouy\n*Chinoiserie\n* Fleur de lis\n* Marble \n* Porcelain\n* Silk\n* Velvet\n*Satin\n\n<br />\n== Architecture ==\nIn architecture, the Baroque period is defined by grandeur: gilded ornamentation, lavish decoration, and spaciousness. The Palace of Versailles and the work of Bernini in Italy exemplify this style.\n\n<br />\n\n== Music ==\nBaroque music is spirited and extravagant, much like its artistic and architectural counterparts. It is characterized by winding, florid melodies, and the bass line often serves as a \"heartbeat\" which drives the music forward.\n\nWell known Baroque composers and some examples of their work:\n\n* Johann Sebastian Bach\n** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdsyNwUoON0 Brandenburg Concerto No. 3]\n** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhRa3REdozw Fugue in G Minor, BWV 574]\n** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcsfDxojdV8 Concerto for Harpsichord in D Minor, BWV 1052]\n* Antonio Vivaldi\n** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkLGp49EpGs&list=PLyrS5_ErY3KQ6KAeraqPfQFeTumSPCMjA The Four Seasons] \n** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nheev87nOHw Concerto in E Minor, RV 281]\n** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z39KxbbtCC0 Aria: \"ah, ch'infelice sempre,\" RV 684]\n* Jean-Baptiste Lully\n** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l539qHREjgE Prelude Pour La Nuit] \n** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnEA97H8OeQ Passacaille from Armide, LWV 71]\n* George Frederic Handel\n** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96Th_y6PGUg Hornpipe from Water Music, HWV 349]\n** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxnBjAaJWCc Aria: \"Lascia ch'io piangia\"]\n* Arcangelo Corelli\n** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFUFWOx6760 Concerto Op. 6 No. 4 in D Major, Adagio-Allegro]\n** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4m1KHjp03M La Folia Variations]\n* Henry Purcell\n** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9M838EiInnQ Strike the Viol]\n** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVivtti-n-w&list=PLoUez0R9r-Z77RXUAfrWGkPAc9vjrC9fF&index=4 Rondeau from Abdelazer]\n\n<br />\n\n== Subgenre ==\n\n=== Rococo ===\n'''Rococo''', often called late Baroque, was an architectural and artistic style developed in France in the first half of the eighteenth century. The king of France, Louis XV, is often thought to be a key patron and supporter of the movement -- a very likely hypothesis considering the monarch's need to differentiate himself from the king who proceeded him: Louis XIV (a key patron of the Baroque style). Rococo takes all of the tropes and trends of Baroque art and exaggerates them until there is nothing but ornamentation and artifice left.\n\n<br />\n\n== LGBT Influence and Contributions ==\nFor LGBT people of the Baroque era, please see the Wikipedia articles for LGBT people in the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:17th-century_LGBT_people 17th] and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:18th-century_LGBT_people 18th] centuries.\n\nIn recent decades, some LGBT people have adopted the Baroque aesthetic as part of their stage or performing act. The trailblazing singer Klaus Nomi used Baroque music, motifs, and costumes in his performances in the 1970s and especially the 1980s. Presently, the singer Prince Poppycock dons stylized Baroque costumes for performances. The popular dancer Carlos Fittante specializes in Baroque-era dance, and often performs in full costume; this dancing provided healing after his partner died in the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks in New York City.   \n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery widths=\"140\" orientation=\"none\" spacing=\"small\">\nThebaroque.jpg\n1a33be65b678334e0cc7e2a61cfbd781.jpg\nBa roque.jpg\n3afa3fc8b1f63fe8ea89927ec826c4f2.jpg\n\"The Swing\" (1767) by Jean-Honore Fragonard..jpg|\"(The Happy Accident's of) the Swing\" (1767) by Jean-Honore Fragonard.
