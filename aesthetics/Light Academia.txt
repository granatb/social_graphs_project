In contrast, Light Academia\u2019s themes are generally positive, focusing on optimism, sensitivity, joy, gratitude, friendship, motivation, and happy endings. \n\nSimilar to Dark Academia, Light Academia involves an interest in literature, music, art, history, and learning. Light Academia visuals, literary inspirations, and philosophical themes are generally Eurocentric and classicist. Some proponents of Light Academia have attempted to resist this Euro-centrism by utilizing academic clothing from non-Western European cultures, and recommending, quoting, and discussing books by non-European, non-English-speaking, and non-white authors.    \n\nHowever, visuals from classical antiquity still play a significant role in Light Academia, and the Western canon are a significant part of the philosophy. Western architecture, including church buildings, libraries, museums, and universities, feature frequently in Light Academia images. Haussmann-era Paris and images of domesticity also differentiate Light from Dark Academia.      \n\n== History ==\nLight Academia was created in a Tumblr text post by the user 'plantaires' on January 17, 2019. The user wrote, \"you\u2019ve heard of \u2018dark academia\u2019, now its time for \u2018light\u2019 academia\u2026 wearing light linen sundresses in foreign countries, eating picnics and pastries in the afternoon sun while reading poetry and laughing with your friends, the burning passion and excitement when you ''finally'' make a breakthrough in your research, falling asleep in your lovers arms sunkissed and happy\u2026 everything is beautiful and hopeful and no one dies.\"<ref>plantaires. (2019, January 17) ''you've heard of 'dark academia', now its time for 'light' academia''. [Text post]. tumblr, archived on Wayback Machine. https://web.archive.org/web/20190503004121/https://plantaires.tumblr.com/post/182093386365/youve-heard-of-dark-academia-now-its-time</ref> As there are no light academia tags, and as demonstrated through its propositional tone, this is the post that created the aesthetic. The dissemination of the term was largely a whim, and it was other users who expanded upon her idea, as opposed to deliberate aesthetic creation, as demonstrated by her confusion in the tags of another text post, where she wrote, \"did I... accidentally coin a term?\"<ref>plantaires. (2019, November). ''did i...accidentally coin a term?''

The photographs are taken in '''natural lighting''', with generous sunshine, often overlapping with [[Golden Hour]] images.\n\n'''Cozy and domestic imagery''' is a popular motif in Light Academia and contributes to the softer and more loving environment of the aesthetic. Unmade beds with books on the sheets, food (typically coffee, bread, and fruit), and cluttered apartments are images that appear more often in Light Academia than Dark. \n\n'''Sculpture is always done in white marble''' and in the styles of Renaissance, Baroque and Neoclassical. Technique, such as in the illusion of flesh, psychological presence, diaphanous fabric and drapery, is admired. These sculptures are extremely popular because they fit into the Light Academia color palette easily.\n\nThe '''artworks''' utilized in light academia come from the periods typically associated with European civilization: Renaissance, [[Baroque]], [[Classicism|Neoclassical]], Academic, Romantic, Aesthetic and Pre-Raphaelite periods are included. However, Light Academia does not emphasize these eras of painting as much as Dark Academia. Rather,  [[Impressionism|'''Impressionist art''']], which uses a light color palette and images of middle class life and nature, making it an overall softer and welcoming atmosphere, is more popular. \n\n'''Baroque, Beaux-Arts and [[Classicism|Neoclassical]]''' '''architecture''' are featured frequently in light academic images, as most of the '''prestigious campuses, museums and libraries''' were built in this style. Rusticated stone, wrought iron fencing, white marble, classical columns and generous ornamentation are common traits shared among these spaces. In addition, '''Haussmannian apartments and streets''' (the \"classic\" Parisian stone buildings with white plaster molded interiors) contribute to the simultaneous elegant and comforting atmosphere. \n\nThe romanticization of studying, journaling and letter-writing is demonstrated through appreciation for '''calligraphy and stationary'''. Fountain pens and typewriters are proudly displayed and users would often take images of the results of their notebook entries, not unlike [[Studyblr]]. However, their writing is cursive and decorations are sparse.\n\n'''Images associated with''' '''literature''' are another common photo subject. Antique books, etchings for chapter pages, screenshots of e-books with highlighted lines, annotations and typography are common. Latin, ancient Greek, English and French are popular in dark academia both as subjects of linguistic study and in aesthetic images of text.\n\n'''Nature''' '''photography, often overlapping with [[Cottagecore]]''', can appear. Fields of grass, bushes of flowers, crawling ivy, and orange groves are some examples. Like Cottagecore, these plants are controlled and mild. \n\nCafe society is also another influence on the aesthetic. '''Coffee shops''' are associated with both the flaneurs of 19th-century Paris and the contemporary stressed college students of today. As such, that space is romanticized and images of coffee, people-watching and studying within the space is popular.\n\n==Fashion==\n===Tops===\n\n*Blazers\n*Turtlenecks\n*Corduroy jackets\n*Cardigans\n*Cable knit sweaters/jumpers\n*Button up shirts/dress shirts\n*Sweater vests\n\n===Bottom===\n\n*Linen shorts\n*Dress pants\n*Cigarette pants\n*Skirts\n\n===Outerwear===\n\n*Trench coats\n*Pea coats\n*Duffle coats\n*Overcoats\n*Waistcoats\n*Uniforms\n\n===Shoes===\n\n*Wingtips\n*Mary Janes\n*Doc Martens\n*Oxford shoes\n\n===Accessories===\n\n*Headbands\n*Glasses\n*Hair ribbons\n*Hair clips\n*Knee high or ruffle socks\n*Watches\n*Leather belts\n*Cufflinks\n*Brooches\n*Pearls\n*Berets\n\n====Colors====\n\n*Browns\n*Cream\n*Rose\n*Burgundy\n*Green\n*Banana yellow\n*Navy blue\n*Beige\n*Off-white\n*Grey\n*Black\n*White\n\n====Patterns and Materials====\n\n*Tweed\n*Corduroy\n*Plaid\n*Leather\n*Houndstooth\n*Gingham\n*Flannel\n*Tartan\n*Madras\n*Linen\n*Knit and crochet\n*Lace\n*Argyle\n*Cashmere\n*Silk/satin\n\n==Room Decor==\n\n* Tea sets\n*Old photos\n*Mini statues\n* Candles\n*Vintage board games\n*Old-looking books\n*Record player\n*Old writing tools (fountain pens, dip pens)\n*Dried/pressed flowers\n* Bookshelves\n*Wood furniture and antique furniture (lighter shades)\n* Fancy, antique mirrors\n* Framed photos and art\n* World globes\n*Posters of classical artwork\n* Upholstered or tuft headboards\n\n==Music==\n\n=== Genres ===\n\n* Baroque Pop\n* Easy Listening\n* Jazz Swing\n* Light Classical\n* Soft Rock\n* Theme/Orchestra\n\n=== Artists ===\n\n* The Beach Boys\n* Billie Holiday\n* Camille\n*Chet Baker\n* The Carpenters\n*Claude Debussy \n* Chopin\n* Edith Piaf\n*Foxygen\n* Frank Sinatra\n* The Ink Spots\n* Lana Del Rey\n*Maurice Ravel \n* The Supremes\n* Vampire Weekend\n* Vince Guaraldi\n*Johannes Bornl\u00f6f\n*Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky\n\n==Films==\n===Movies===\n\n* The African Doctor (2016)\n* Another Country (1984)\n* Billy Elliot (2000)\n* The Boy Who Harnessed The Wind (2019)\n* Dead Poets Society (1989)\n* The Emperor's Club (2002)\n* Enola Holmes (2020)\n* Everybody Wants Some!!
