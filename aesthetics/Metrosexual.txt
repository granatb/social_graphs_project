This term was coined in 1994, and is typically used to refer to a man living in an urban, post-industrial, consumerist culture.<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metrosexual</ref> The term is a portmanteau of metropolitan and heterosexual, as metrosexuals often live in an urban, post-industrial, capitalist culture. \n\nThe term today is outdated, as society's lean towards male body acceptance has accepted this type of self-care rather than fetishize or degrade it. The terms was also created as a way to voice confusion over whether or not a man was gay or not in the 90s, as stereotypes in the 90s against gay men ran high. \n\n\n\n== Fashion ==\n* Suits\n*Khakis\n*Polos\n*Boat shoes\n*Dress shoes\n\n== Activities ==\n* Getting a pedicure (or even a manicure)\n* Going to the gym\n* Shopping\n* Skincare\n\n== References ==\n* https://www.nytimes.com/2003/06/22/style/metrosexuals-come-out.html\n* https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/19/fashion/sundaystyles/gay-or-straight-hard-to-tell.html\n[[Category:Fashion]]\n[[Category:Visual]]\n[[Category:Needs work]]\n[[Category:Masculine]]\n[[Category:Mature]]"}}}]}}}}
