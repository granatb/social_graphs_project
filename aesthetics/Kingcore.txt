Like Queencore is to [[Princesscore]], Kingcore is a more mature variant of [[Princecore]]. Themes of power, war, and conquest are more often seen here, as kings are most often viewed as malicious entities; although this is not true for all works or historical accounts. \n\nKingcore aesthetics show through strength and guidance, skill and patience. Those who adopt a Kingcore aesthetic may be seen as the leader of a group. They hold themselves to higher standards, as a way to show worthiness of their title and position. The Kingcore aesthetic wouldn't be complete without confidence and displays of good leadership. A different approach using evil kings as inspiration can prove ill-advised, as this may make the person appear selfish and inconsiderate with a disregard for others.\n\nInspiration can be drawn from patriarchal figures in hierarchy-centered shows and movies, especially those centered around kingdoms. For a darker approach, colors can be toned deeper, and inspiration can be drawn from evil king characters and CEOs. This aesthetic can be great inspiration for modern styles.\n\n== Visuals ==\nVisuals for kingcore coincide with other royalcore visuals. Significant visuals for kings may include:\n\n* Pointed crowns\n* Black horses\n* War rooms\n* Steel weapons\n* Chess and chess boards\n* Oil paintings\n* Smoke\n* Fire\n* Military uniforms\n* Metal chest plate armor\n* Coats of Arms\n* Lions\n\n== Fashion ==\nFashion may be taken directly from historical accounts or may be modernized.
