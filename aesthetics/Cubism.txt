Cubism has been considered the most influential art movement of the 20th century. The movement was pioneered by Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque, joined by Jean Metzinger, Albert Gleizes, Robert Delaunay, Henri Le Fauconnier, and Fernand L\u00e9ger. One primary influence that led to Cubism was the representation of three-dimensional form in the late works of Paul C\u00e9zanne.\n\n== Visual ==\n''Under Construction''\n\n== Architecture ==\nCubism formed an important link between early 20th century art and architecture. The historical, theoretical, and socio-political relationships between avant-garde practices in painting, sculpture and architecture had early ramifications in France, Germany, the Netherlands and Czechoslovakia. Though there are many points of intersection between Cubism and architecture, only a few direct links between them can be drawn. Most often the connections are made by reference to shared formal characteristics: faceting of form, spatial ambiguity, transparency, and multiplicity.\n\n== Literature ==\nWhile Cubism was primarily an art movement that focussed on visual arts, there were some authors who were influenced by Cubism. This influenced the use of an internal landscape (for characters), stream of consciousness, multiple perspectives, and fragmentation of the individual.<ref>https://penandthepad.com/cubism-writing-12197040.html</ref>\n\n===Authors===\n* William Faulkner\n* James Joyce\n* Gertrude Stein\n* Virginia Woolf\n\n===Books===\n* ''As I Lay Dying,'' by William Faulkner\n* ''A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man,'' by James Joyce\n* ''Mrs. Dalloway,'' by Virginia Woolf\n\n== Famous Artists ==\n\n* Georges Braque\n* Romero Britto\n* Robert Delaunay\n* Albert Gleizes \n* Henri Le Fauconnier\n* Fernand L\u00e9ger\n* Jean Metzinger\n* Pablo Picasso\n\n\n== Subgenres ==\n\n=== Crystal Cubism ===\n'''Crystal Cubism'''\u00a0is a distilled form of\u00a0Cubism with a strong emphasis on flat surface activity and large \noverlapping geometric planes. The primacy of the underlying geometric \nstructure, rooted in the abstract, controls practically all of the \nelements of the artwork.\n\n=== Czech Cubism ===\n'''Czech Cubism'''\u00a0(referred to more generally as\u00a0Cubo-Expressionism)\u00a0was an\u00a0avant-garde\u00a0art movement\u00a0of\u00a0Czech\u00a0proponents of\u00a0Cubism.\n\nCzech Cubists distinguish their work through the construction of sharp points, slicing planes, and crystalline shapes in their art works.These angles allowed the Czech Cubists to incorporate their own trademark in the avant-garde art group of\u00a0Modernism.\n\nThey believed that objects carried their own inner energy which \ncould only be released by splitting the horizontal and vertical surfaces that restrain the conservative design and \u201cignore the needs of the human soul.\u201d It was a way to revolt from the typical art scene in the \nearly 1900s in Europe.\n\n=== Orphic Cubism ===\n'''Orphism''' or Orphic Cubism, a term coined by the French poet Guillaume Apollinaire in 1912, was an offshoot of Cubism that focused on pure abstraction and bright colors, influenced by Fauvism, the theoretical writings of Paul Signac, Charles Henry and the dye chemist Eug\u00e8ne Chevreul.\n\n=== Tubism ===\n'''Tubism'''\u00a0is a term coined by the art critic\u00a0Louis \nVauxcelles\u00a0in\u00a01911\u00a0to describe the style of French artist\u00a0Fernand L\u00e9ger.\nMeant as derision, the term was inspired by L\u00e9ger's idiosyncratic \nversion of\u00a0Cubism, in which he emphasized\u00a0cylindrical\u00a0shapes.\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\n\n2*282716611.jpeg|Crystal Cubism\n9k=Dmns.jpeg|Czech Cubism\nEPzcJX1W4AApvx7.jpg|Tubism\nFile:Zbbbbbbbb.jpeg|Orphism or Orphic Cubism\nPicasso-fruit-violin-bottle.jpg|Bowl of Fruit, Violin and Bottle (Picasso)\nPicasso-girl-mandolin.jpg|Girl with a Mandolin (Picasso)\nJuan Gris 1915 Nature morte.jpg|Nature morte \u00e0 la nappe \u00e0 carreaux (Juan Gris)\nAnatole-krasnyansky-dancer.jpg|Dancer (Anatole Krasnyansky, 2006)\nRomero-britto-blue-couple.jpg|Blue Couple (Romero Britto, 2016)\nVenus-xxiv.jpg|Venus XXIV (Romero Britto, 2018)\n\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n\n[[Category:Visual]]\n[[Category:Art]]\n[[Category:Needs work]]\n[[Category:Written]]\n[[Category:Music]]\n[[Category:Czech]]\n[[Category:French]]\n[[Category:Art movements]]\n<references />\n[[Category:Ism suffix]]"}}}]}}}}
