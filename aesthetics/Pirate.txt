It \nusually involves boats, the sea, and treasure rather than actual crime.\nIt draws its inspiration from aesthetics such as [[Adventurecore]] and [[Crowcore]], and may include things such as: collecting shells/rocks/trinkets/bones/etc, studying maps and constellations, sea travel, and sketching. Some may even take pride in their weaponry, mainly consisting of swords and daggers. \n\nPeople valuing Pirate aesthetics either have strong aspirations to travel the oceans, or ties to beachside mountains and/or homes. \n\nThe aesthetic does get slight criticism due to the bad reputation of pirates in history. Though, the aesthetic itself does not value stealing and thieving, nor does it mean to present colonialism. The community around this aesthetic instead value freedom, fairness, curiosity and balance. Loyalty is a large factor in Pirate, and a moral code is usually presented. They are interested in the unknown and the mysteries of the ocean, and believe in hard work and a strength of heart and mind.\n\n== Visuals ==\n[[File:Pirate-s-cove-ormond.jpg|thumb|272x272px]]\n* Old/rusted coins and other gold trinkets\n* Rocks\n* Corals\n* Fossils\n*Waves\n* Marine skeletons/skulls\n*Sand\n* Vintage lockets and watches\n*Ships\n*Quills & ink\n*Hourglasses\n*Compasses\n*Keys\n* Sculptures relating to the sea\n*Seaweed\n* Coastal cliffs\n\n== Hobbies/Activities ==\n[[File:540d8ddf87ece7629092c2ce5d3fda17.jpg|thumb|217x217px]]\n\n* Collecting rocks, shells and minerals\n* Collecting small bones, skeletons or fossils\n* Practicing in arts of fencing or using swords and daggers\n* Collecting constellation charts and maps\n* Stargazing\n*Sailing\n*Hand-writing letters\n* Sea travel or coastline travel\n*Collecting coins or stamps\n* Thrifting for trinkets and other items 'one man's trash is another man's treasure'\n* Sketching coastlines, horizons, mountains, etc\n\n==Fashion==\n[[File:503580e3c052b034e965b7f3514cb63c.jpg|thumb]]\nSimilar to [[Cottagecore]], [[Dark Academia]], and [[Adventurecore]] with some aspects of styles considered 'hippie' or 'boho'. \n[[File:B209c01bb03347c2c3ffd95956e35080.jpg|thumb|191x191px]]\n\n* Flowing maxi dresses\n* Corsets/corset belts\n* Ruffles\n* Breathable layers\n* Oversized blouses or breathable tops\n* Neutral colors of blues, browns, reds, greens, ivory, etc\n* Tight or baggy pants \n* Flannels\n* Lace\n*Leather jackets\n* Oversized blazers\n* Fingerless gloves\n* Heeled boots and sandals\n* Square belts\n\n\nAccessories can vary but are usually scarves, beads, chains and handmade jewellery, and unlike the neutral colors of the clothing, will range from bright colours to metallics. \n\n== Decor ==\n[[File:185f9f58fe9297c3d033fe565e0808a6.jpg|thumb|240x240px]]\nPirate design uses a lot of rustic, beachy, industrial and vintage elements.
