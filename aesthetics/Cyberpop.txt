The style features cyberfalls, neon colored hairstyles, and partially shaved hairstyles. The form of clothing follows the conventions found in [[cybergoth]], but all black and grunge elements are removed. It's apt to say that cyberpop is the child of [[cybergoth]] and kandi kid aesthetic styles. \n\n== Fashion ==\nThe key difference between [[cybergoth]] and cyberpop is the lack of a usage of black and grey in the latter. Cyberpop also contains more elements of [[atompunk]] in the usage of retro-future rings and shoulder puffs. 90s and early 2000's future fashion aesthetic found in [[Y2K]] is also influential. The color palette is similar to United States kandi kid [[raver]] aesthetics, but differs in that blue jean materials are never used. Both [[raver]] and cyberpop fashion makes use of neon colored UFO pants, both wide legged and draw string. It would be correct to say that cyberpop is a sub-type of [[raver]] fashion, as well as [[cybergoth]] fashion, though it also takes influences from harajuku styles such as [[decora]]. \n\nHairstyles usually dye the entire head in neon shades, rather than just adding stripes or partial color. Multiple colors are also used, and designs such as stars, hearts, space ships or animal prints may be dyed into shaved portions of the head. Dreadfalls were common from 2010-2016 but have declined in popularity out of respect for black communities. Wigs may be used in place of natural hair to create varied styles.\n\nHeadwear often makes use of goggles, neon plastic headbands and neon colored snap back hats with acrylic designs bolted directly onto the hat. And abundance of hairclips may also be used as seen in decora, or other more eclectic hair pieces may be pinned to the hair. As long as the colors are bright anything may be used, but especially things that follow a futuristic theme such as stars, planets, or spaceships. \n\nTops often have orbit type rings around the collar or on the sleeves to emulate a retro-future energy. This styling can also be seen on skirts, shorts, pants, shrugs or jackets. Neon faux fur is extremely common as trim on jackets and shrugs. Entire skirts may also use faux fur. Jump suits reminiscent of space suits are often seen, as are futuristic neon styled overalls featuring giant plastic buttons.\n\nShoes are often platformed, but high top skate sneakers in neon colors are not uncommon. Even canvas high tops may be used as long as the colors match the rest of the outfit. Gogo boots paired with fluffy leg warmers (as are common in raver fashion) are often seen here, though cyberpop adds it's own flair to fluffy legwarmers sometimes in the form of giant buttons.\n\nAccessories are often made from neon laser cut acrylic into space-themed shapes or words. Alien space ships, rocket ships, stars and shooting stars are common motifs for necklace wear in cyberpop fashion. The brand Cyberdog is famous for it's shield necklace which is widely worn by all members of the cyberpop and cybergoth communities, featuring soft plastic in a 'V' line with holes along it's surface. \n\n== Resources==\nExternal links to help get a better understanding of this aesthetic.\n\n===Vendors===\n\n* [https://aikafuture.wixsite.com/electronics Aika Electronics]\n* [https://www.cyberdog.net/ Cyberdog]\n* [https://www.kissmekillme.fr/ Kiss Me Kill Me]\n\n==Gallery ==\n<gallery widths=\"130\" orientation=\"landscape\" bordercolor=\"#fb7cb4\" bordersize=\"small\" captionposition=\"below\" captionalign=\"center\" captionsize=\"medium\">\nZoe van west wearing kill me kiss me brand.jpg|alt=Zoe van west wearing kill me kiss me brand|thumb|Zoe van west wearing kill me kiss me brand\nBlack sunshine corset by bubble fusion.png|black sunshine corset by bubble fusion\nCyberpop shaved hair with animal print design.jpg|alt=Cyberpop shaved hair with animal print design|thumb|Cyberpop shaved hair with animal print design\nLeopard print cyberpop hairstyle.jpg|alt=Leopard print cyberpop hairstyle|thumb|Leopard print cyberpop hairstyle with dreadfalls\nInstagram user happyunbirthday1.jpg|alt=Instagram user happyunbirthday1, note the playsuit, hairfalls and alien motifs|thumb|Instagram user happyunbirthday1, note the playsuit, hairfalls and alien motifs\nTypical cyberpop look.jpg|Typical cyberpop look\nKill me kiss me brand.jpg|alt=Kill me kiss me brand cyberpop outfits|thumb|Kill me kiss me brand cyberpop outfits\nAn example of masculine cyberpop.jpg|alt=An example of masculine cyberpop|thumb|An example of masculine cyberpop\nThe widely used shield necklace.jpg|alt=The widely used shield necklace in various colors|thumb|The widely used shield necklace in various colors\nPop_aesthetic.jpg\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Fashion]]\n[[Category:Visual]]\n[[Category:Needs work]]"}}}]}}}}
