It encompasses the Academia aesthetic (classic literature, the pursuit of self-discovery, and a general passion for knowledge and learning), but with more serious and mature themes (unlike [[Romantic Academia]]). It takes what [[Dark Academia]] is about and turns it up to 11, incorporating gothic studies, literature, poetry, arts, architecture, music, and general [[Goth|Gothic]] related topics. It is related to finding beauty within the darkest places.\n\n== Visual ==\nSome common visuals of Darkest Academia include cobblestone alleyways, study nooks shrouded in shadows, spiraling thunderstorm clouds atop ancient libraries, and a scowling face among a desolate study room. \n\nMuch like Dark Academia, the Darkest Academia aesthetic can visually be depicted in a sophisticated setting albeit with a more somber and highly prestigious twist. A darkest academic can be found in a \"Thinker Pose\" over a collection of Edgar Allan Poe's poems paired with black coffee.\n\nHowever, if your personal life does not visually match up to this aesthetic, that is entirely okay (your life does not have to be completely DA to be considered a Darkest Academic). Aesthetic communities should make the individual feel comfortable and accepted regardless of lifestyle, race, gender identity, sexual orientation, etc. A Darkest Academic should inherently be focused on the pursuit of knowledge and the betterment of oneself. The visual aesthetics are just an add-on.\n\nSome examples of visual inspiration include dark libraries, reading in the evening, old books, solitude, night skies, dark nights on storms, rain clouds, and thunder. These are basic ideas that you could branch off of.\n\n== Fashion ==\n* Brown tweed jackets\n* Dress shoes\n* Scarves\n*Black dress pants\n*Black turtlenecks\n*Black Dock Martens\n*Extremely Dark Colors\n*Semi-Baggy Sweaters\n\n==Written==\nMany popular works within Darkest Academia generally have a dark, gothic atmosphere to them. Some of the influential writers are:\n\n* Anne Rice\n* Ann Radcliffe\n* Bram Stoker\n* Carson McCullers\n* Charlaine Harris\n* Cormac McCarthy\n* Dorothy Allison\n* Edgar Allan Poe\n* Eudora Welty\n*Fyodor Dostoevsky\n* Harry Crews\n* Horace Walpole\n*Howard Phillips Lovecraft\n* Matthew Gregory Lewis\n* Mary Shelley\n* Toni Morrison\n* Truman Capote\n* William Faulkner\n\n==Music==\nDarkest academia music is typically calm and soothing. It is usually relaxed jazz or classical piano. Since it is Darkest Academia, the sound and feel of the music would be a bit emotional. For example, a piece called \"Notre Dame, Notre Potrimoine\" by ''Leon Noel''. It is a classical piano piece that has a darker tone. Darkest Academia is not entirely, but for the most part, filled with somber music. A jazzy example would be, \"A Little Death\" by ''The Neighbourhood.'' A popular artist associated with this aesthetic and similar ones is ''Hozier.''\n\n=== Playlists  ===\n==== Spotify ====\n*\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1lPq52CHmfpSuuwdFUYeJz?si=ddf1Ag-7RlORVBQkCwYy2w dark academia murder mystery Spotify playlist by Mer\ud83d\udd2a]\n*\n*[https://open.spotify.com/user/allieakerley2000/playlist/6i8KZ6odeglN3N9XRGiFfu Darkest Academia Spotify playlist by allie_akerley]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0Mluomh7WiS15jBMyelroO?si=sRI1crOXTLSe7QszMJPl7Q losing touch Spotify playlist by bellue]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/user/wolfandlion/playlist/2AMHnkK0UFNn8dlYk4mUAi DARKEST ACADEMIA Spotify playlist by wolfandlion]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/user/ianragan47/playlist/5uCqmgJaY4IgecpveyPUwM to teach the darkness Spotify playlist by ianragan47]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/user/zuyji06on2n33991mlxlmlss1/playlist/3At3xkoMenWKgL5Ljci8hX Darkest Academia \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffb Spotify playlist by Emily]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/50cOIb68xJl8UwZciXDO6u?si=a692e76836f94d44 Classical Dark Academia by Gaby Sena]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/71z1L3XDCdlEcU5LF7M1Un?si=cd3591a9262f451d Dark Academia Spotify Playlist by Albert Louis Baker]\n\n==== YouTube ====\n*[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIOJuaxQbZrJZmaV-o18lJoFBYXvdBtaA Darkest Academia YouTube playlist by WHat nOOOoo]\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery widths=\"130\" spacing=\"small\">\n\n48d1400f98095464a7cfa276f1195167--running-in-the-rain-fitness-goals.jpg\nTumblr 4a12748fe6025e6324d188995ccf2534 0ebf348f 640.jpg\nTumblr b26b1d3dd4d4a29cee00e207877c54f6 b1b3733f 640.jpg\nCreepy book.jpg\nDark academia.jpg\nRed scare dasha.jpg\n009b901906d4ee9996696ddacd5adcca.jpg\n513fec9a8103f04bf41720ed038e6c53.jpg\n6870e1214480fa9ce95d5f6e7f8af12b.jpg\nFile:Gothic Academia .jpg\nFile:Gothic Academia.jpg\nFile:Gothic Academia-0.jpg\n\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Academia]]\n[[Category:Written]]\n[[Category:Visual]]\n[[Category:Fashion]]\n[[Category:Music]]"}}}]}}}}
