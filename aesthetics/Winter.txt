It involves snow, sweaters/jumpers, the colour white, and the cold. It can also be a reference to Winter fashion styles.\n\nDuring this time of the year, people tend to stay more at their homes to not be exposed to the low temperatures, making the season be associated with more calm, cozy elements. Some examples are staying at home near a fireplace, wrapped around a blanket, watching a movie, and reading books. It is also closely tied to the holiday of [[Christmas]], which in itself has values of unity and kindness. Foods are served while hot, such as hot cocoa, tea, lace and gingerbread cookies, fruitcakes, soup, and ham.\n\nWinter isn't always a low energy time for everyone, since it has various exclusive sports and activities. This can include sledding, skiing, ice-skating, hockey, snowball fights, and curling, to name a few.\n<br />\n== Fashion and Food ==\nDuring this season, more thick clothes are required to withstand the sometimes subzero temperatures, and the outfits themselves have more neutral, darker colors. A few pieces include:\n\n* Gloves\n* Sweaters\n* Jumpers\n* Puffer coats\n* Knee-high and short boots\n* Scarfs\n* Turtleneck shirts\n\n* Heavy furred coats and jackets<br />\n\nLike [[Summer]], there are some foods and drinks that are good for Winter. Some include:\n\n* Mug Cake\n* Hot chocolate\n* Eggnog\n* Gingerbread Cookies\n* Tomato Soup\n* Ham\n* Sugar Cookies\n* Cranberries\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery widths=\"150\" spacing=\"small\" orientation=\"square\">\nWinter10.jpg\nWinter9.jpg\nWinter8.jpg\nWinter7.jpg\nWinter6.jpg\nWinter5.jpg\nWinter4.jpg\nWinter3.jpg\nWinter1.jpg\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Visual]]\n[[Category:Needs work]]\n[[Category:Fashion]]\n[[Category:Seasonal]]"}}}]}}}}
