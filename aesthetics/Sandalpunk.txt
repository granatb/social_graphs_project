This would potentially lead to a less-isolated retro-futurist Greece that was never conquered or a retro-futurist Roman Empire that never fell. Prime examples would be the mechanical wonders in films like\u00a0Jason and the Argonauts\u00a0(1963)\u00a0and\u00a0Clash of the Titans\u00a0(1981)\u00a0or the\u00a0God of War\u00a0video game series. High-technology in such works is rare (usually a \"one-off\" by a genius philosopher or a hand-crafted \"trade secret\" product made by workshops of artificiers) but potentially indistinguishable from miracles or magic. Another example is the retro-futuristic blend of Imperial Rome and 1930s Fascist Italy in\u00a0Julie Taymor's\u00a0Titus\u00a0(1999). There are motor vehicles, radios, and simple firearms, but war is still waged by armor-clad troops with swords and spears.\n\n== Media ==\n\n* '''''Jason and the Argonauts''''' ( movie )\n* '''''Clash of the Titans''''' (movie)\n*'''''Son of Zeus''''' ( netflix animated show )\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery widths=\"185\">\nLiudmyla-stoian-soldiersmall.jpg\nBnUDTQwIYAA -n6.png\nCyborg by godzillama dbn2bbm-fullview.jpg\nTumblr p34ora6VBM1rwhn8ro1 1280.jpg\nLiudmyla-stoian-rome07environmentprojectsmalll.jpg\nE32b5f0e932008bd2fd37f25493bc144b65179ac_hq.jpg\n</gallery><br />\n==References==\n* https://allthetropes.fandom.com/wiki/Sandal_Punk\n[[Category:Written]]\n[[Category:Punk Suffix]]\n[[Category:Needs work]]\n[[Category:Visual]]"}}}]}}}}
