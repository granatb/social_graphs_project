Popular motifs include hearts, boxes of chocolate, lipstick, love letters, cupid, angels, and the colours red and pink. There are also at times vintage elements present in the form of scans of Valentines Day cards written in the 1950s and 60s. There is sometimes overlap with [[anime]] in the form of pink manga edits and images of anime characters with hearts in their eyes.\n\n\n\nAs the aesthetic became more intense and anime-centric, a subcategory of lovecore called [[Anime#Yandere|Yandere]] appeared. Lovecore tends to focus on the commercialization of love through Valentine's Day and marketing as well as wholesome celebration of love rather than the dark, macabre or erotic. \n\nLovecore originated on Tumblr.\n\n== Visuals ==\n\n* Anime characters who are blushing or have hearts around them\n* Anything shaped like a heart and in the lovecore colors\n* Bouquets of flowers\n* Cakes with pink frosting and cherries\n* Candy such as lollipops or chocolates that are heart-shaped and pink or red\n* Cupid imagery such as angel wings and arrows\n* Cute animals such as kittens or dogs\n* Lipstick\n* Paper Valentines Day cards\n* Stuffed animals\n* Typography expressing quotes about love\n*\"Tunnel of Love\" amusement park rides\n\n==Fashion==\nLovecore fashion hints at a mix of lingerie, angel wings, satin dresses, and just general formal date wear, though sometimes people who identify with the aesthetic adopt a [[softie]] look or opt for graphic t-shirts with the aforementioned themes. [[Larme Kei|Larme-styled]] outfits are also popular. Colors like pink, red, and white, as well as motifs such as hearts and lipstick marks, are also fairly common. Some garments include:   \n\n* Crop tops with puffed sleeves, shirring, and other feminine details   \n* Heart-patterned garments and accessories   \n* Slip dresses with satin and lace   \n* Turtlenecks with a tighter fit   \n\n== Activities ==\n* Writing/decorating love letters\n* Baking\n* Thinking about your crush/partner\n* Kissing\n* Holding hands\n* Cuddling\n* Going on dates\n\n== Subgenres ==\n=== Pagano-Lovecore ===\n[[File:Aphrodite-adonis-painting.jpg|thumb|222x222px|Painting of Goddess Aphrodite and her lover Adonis]]\n'''Pagano-Lovecore''' focuses on the iconography of love in Greco-Roman mythology and the Italian Renaissance, rather than the Christian tradition. Fixated on Greco-Roman gods and goddesses, beautiful statues, doves, old jewelry, ancient love poetry, and other antique things in Rome or ancient Greece. Figures include Aphrodite, Eros, Adonis, and other love deities. Easy overlap with [[Dark Academia]]. More deities and visuals can be found at [[Hellenic]].  \n\n==== Visual Boards ====\n\n* [https://www.pinterest.com/Isabellebeee/pagano-lovecore-academia/ Pagano Lovecore Academia by Bella] \n* [https://www.pinterest.com/ashleighjudson/pagano-lovecore-academia/ Pagano Lovecore Academia by Ashleigh Judson]  \n* [https://www.pinterest.com/pjofangirl2/pagano-lovecore-aesthetic/ pagano lovecore aesthetic by Meg] \n*[https://www.pinterest.com/lauradigirolamogallardo/aphrodite-aesthetic/ aphrodite aesthetic by Laura Di Girolamo Gallardo]<br />\n=== Shakespearean Lovecore ===\n'''Shakespearean Lovecore''' has a heavy focus on the element of romance as depicted in the works of famed playwright William Shakespeare (a popular figure of this particular aesthetic being Juliet Capulet of the play ''Romeo & Juliet''). Due to the common portrayal of romance in Shakespeare's works, there is often a somberness and an element of tragedy to this particular brand of Lovecore. Common motifs and values in Shakespearean Lovecore include poetry, antique furniture, dresses, literature, forbidden/tragic love, and art/architecture often depicted in the time period of his plays (Italian architecture in particular being quite popular due to ''Romeo & Juliet'' taking place in Verona, Italy and it being among Shakespeare's most well-known work). \n\n==== Visual Boards ====\n*[https://www.pinterest.com/anactualmess/shakespearean-lovecore/ shaksepearean lovecore by vibingmess] \n\n=== Victorian Lovecore ===\n'''Victorian Lovecore''' focuses on the often-macabre romantic aesthetic of the Victorian era. \n\n<br />\n\n== Boards ==\n\n*[https://www.pinterest.com/themoonflowertent/aesthetics-lovecore-101/ aesthetics: lovecore 101 by Moonflower]\n*[https://www.pinterest.com/Lady_Hydra/lovecore/ Lovecore by Lady Hydra]\n* [https://www.pinterest.com/cocaineheadass/lovecore/ LOVECORE by space cowboy]\n* [https://www.pinterest.com/faeriesope/lovecore/ lovecore \u2727 by faeriesope]\n* [https://www.pinterest.com/vendraprog/lovecore/ lovecore by \ud835\udd30\ud835\udd2c\ud835\udd2d\ud835\udd25\ud835\udd26\ud835\udd1e]\n* [https://www.pinterest.com/bombasine/retro-lovecore/ Retro Lovecore by Alexandra Tinsley]\n* [https://www.pinterest.com/uwufrankie/lovecore/ lovecore by francesca <3]\n* [https://www.pinterest.com/celestivl/aes-lovecore/ aes ; lovecore by sophie]\n*[https://www.pinterest.ca/srkt11/valentine/ valentine by S]\n*[https://www.pinterest.com/facesfacesfaces/3/ <3 by mercury]\n*[https://www.pinterest.com/yukikookie/aphrodite-aesthetic/ aphrodite aesthetic by yukikookie] (more general lovecore than pagano)<br />\n\n== Music ==\n* [https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4kgEyIyq481oKgP5a0YAw5?si=ff99de2b8b704b2e \u2661 (lovecore)] by miraya \u2601\ufe0f \n* [https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7q3WH808B5IxXoqvjTLo2i?si=LYbRGozuSveYvhv2GEHIXg lovecore Spotify playlist by constellacoding]\n* [https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2JC7NhpAMdBS57JUTkvF7N?si=rxmrp3WART20s-KRqKnW4A Lovecore Spotify playlist by kylerclodfelter]\n* [https://open.spotify.com/playlist/772L8VzJVoifB6zdGH1vij?si=hxcs288hRPumWjILDW6cew Lovecore Spotify playlist by Nicole]\n* [https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1YCZYTBFLJT46KhDx46jFV?si=ymnFdusiS3GLNNg9cK1z7Q Lovecore \ud83d\udc8b Spotify playlist by lotspot-nl]\n* [https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4utjaSbSAO8XsOrO5Jm7S2?si=s237T5xNTOK8AzHY0szt3A lovecore\ud83d\udc98 Spotify playlist by sparklinggoth]\n* [https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1z57ck6ngRzDdqjgxcpoWB?si=KMompNZiQ6WJ1CdGLu9bJQ lovecore Spotify playlist by Allan]\n* [https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7wTX0PYxTHtToSXI800VWH?si=Rcrx4kLwQXyAoTKchxpz3g \ud83d\udc96\u2763\ufe0f\ud83d\udc95 LOVECORE \ud83d\udc95\u2763\ufe0f\ud83d\udc96 Spotify playlist by archieonthetree]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6SI5kDc8CJ8AquMEmw9dPu amorcito Spotify playlist by grape<3]\n*I Do Adore by Mindy Gledhill\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"130\" orientation=\"square\" spacing=\"small\">\n254e3ec861f4f190e110796d60a2137d.jpg\nPink-love-pretty-in-pink.jpg\n5504b4736ed29db6110339356d04124c.jpg\nYou are loved.jpg\nTumblr prrgzk792s1trb380 400.jpg\n8c0a5f5d2549ecf15dc6e7b82158db4d.jpg\nDc4li48-866e877f-d4a9-4191-b322-39d34f00a415.png\nCandy-hearts.png\nTumblr psyk8nO8mt1trb380 400.jpg\nTumblr pmhe2etHvl1xpbltwo1 500.png\n35502994 255804871667289 6648872350760566784 n.jpg\nSimple-love-background-red-like.jpg\nBFC5.jpg\nPink-heart-bathtub-love.png\nYour love will be safe with me.jpg\nBright-red-heart-lovecore-aesthetic.jpg\n895319a8411818871fc58f02afa8484c.jpg|[[Anime]] and Lovecore\nWholesomememe.jpg|[[Cartooncore]] Lovecore image\nOriginal.jpg|Another example of Cartooncore lovecore\nCrushcore Aesthetic.png\nTumblr nsf4hsiBh61u3d0hzo1 1280.jpg\nLove-neon-light.jpg\nENjx9ZUW4AASYxw.jpg\nSweetheart battle.png|Sweetheart from OMORI.
