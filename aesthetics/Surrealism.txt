Artists painted unnerving, illogical scenes, sometimes with\u00a0photographic precision, creating strange creatures from everyday objects, and developing painting techniques that allowed the\u00a0unconscious\u00a0to express itself. Its aim was, according to\u00a0Breton, to \"resolve the previously contradictory conditions of dream and reality into an absolute reality, a super-reality\", or\u00a0surreality''.''\n\n== Values ==\nSurrealism rejected any rational version of life, and favored a vision that was influenced by dreams and the unconscious mind. Some surrealists would draw or write without paying much attention to what they were creating, while others sought to depict their dream worlds.<ref>https://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/s/surrealism</ref> \n\n== Artists ==\n* Jean Arp\n* Andre Breton\n* Leonora Carrington\n* Salvador Dal\u00ed\n* Paul Delvaux\n* Max Ernst\n* Andr\u00e9 Masson\n* Ren\u00e9 Magritte\n* Joan Mir\u00f3\n* Paul Nash\n* Meret Oppenheim\n* Pierre Roy\n* Kay Sage\n* Yves Tanguy\n* Dorothea Tanning\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nDali-narcissus.jpg|Metamorphosis of Narcissus (Salvador Dali, 1937)\nNash-megaliths.jpg|Equivalents for the Megaliths (Paul Nash, 1935)\nNash-dream landscape.jpg|Landscape for a Dream (Paul Nash)\nThis-is-not-a-pipe.jpg|The Treachery of Images (Ren\u00e9 Magritte, 1929) (Eng. \"This is not a pipe.\")\nThe-Persistence-of-Memory-dali.jpg|The Persistence of Memory (Salvador Dali, 1931)\nCarnival-of-harlequin.jpg|Carnival of Harlequin (Joan Mir\u00f3)\nRene-human-condition.jpg|The Human Condition (Rene Magritte, 1933)\nPapa-is-wounded.jpg|Mama, Papa is Wounded (Yves Tanguy, 1927)\nInterlude.17.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n== References ==\nhttps://www.theartstory.org/movement/surrealism/\n\n[[Category:Movement]]\n[[Category:Visual]]\n[[Category:Needs work]]\n[[Category:Art]]\n[[Category:Art movements]]\n[[Category:Plagiarized]]\n[[Category:Ism suffix]]"}}}]}}}}
