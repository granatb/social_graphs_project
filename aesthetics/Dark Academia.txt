Whatever we call beautiful, we quiver before it.\u201d -Donna Tartt, The Secret History}}  \n\n'''Dark academia''' is a popular (and the original) [[:Category:Academia|academic]] aesthetic that revolves around classic literature, the pursuit of self-discovery and a general passion for knowledge and learning. It is one of several variations of academia aesthetic, each with a unique subject focus.  \n\nDark academia's visuals stem primarily from upper-class European culture of the 19th century and [[Preppy|American Prep]]. The upper class of this time period emphasized a liberal education in which Latin, rhetoric and classics were taught subjects. These are now seen as unusual and slightly esoteric, creating an allure that presents schooling as not dreary or boring, but one that cultivates mystery, curiosity, and diligence that isn't commonly seen in contemporary school. \n\nPretentiousness is celebrated within the dark academia community. Romanticizing education and moments in life is the core appeal of the aesthetic. Making grandiose statements and wishes for success is a common text post subject.\n\nOther than the appreciation of learning, dark academia thought includes themes of criminality, danger and mystery. Secret societies, cults and murder are subjects within the aesthetic. Characters within the works of fiction associated with Dark Academia, specifically ''The Secret History'' and ''Kill Your Darlings'', live decadent and self-destructive lifestyles involving drugs, moments of intense violence and secrets.\n\nPeople who use this aesthetic are usually referred to as dark academics. However, using this term in other contexts could potentially cause confusion as the title \"academic\" typically refers to researchers and professors, while dark academics do not necessarily have recognized credentials.\n\n<br />\n\n\n<br />\n\n== History ==\nIt is important to note that in multiple ways, dark academia is not new. Rather, it is a continuation of different pre-existing aesthetics that had a basis in artistic periods, literature and mannerisms surrounding the upper class. The Dark Academia aesthetic referred to in this article is within the context of mid-late 2010s-early 2020s internet culture wherein users, largely teenagers, discuss the contents of the page online. This phenomenon is largely confined to social media such as tumblr, Instagram and Tiktok.\n\nThe largest and most notable influence on the aesthetic is the ideas and lifestyles of Romantic-era nobles and intellectuals such as Lord Byron, Percy Shelley, Mary Shelley and Edmund Burke. The cohort was known for writing poetry and prose of great beauty while living languid and privileged lives. Their works emphasized emotion, imagination, and the historical. Much of their poetry, art, and prose is posted on social media sites.   \n\nThe later Aesthetic and Decadent movement, headed by Oscar Wilde, lends the \"dandy\" and homosexual aspects of the internet aesthetic.  \n\nAll of these historic periods were reflected in Donna Tartt's ''The Secret History''. The sublime, picturesque and beautiful are concepts frequently repeated by the narrator, Richard Papen; the main characters vacation in a remote mansion and get drunk, discuss intellectually stimulating topics and lived decadently, like the Romantic poets did in their famed Geneva trip; and the ritual for Bacchanal is a representation of the same fascination with the irrational. \n\nAppreciation for Donna Tartt herself comes from the Esquire article \"The Secret Oral History of Bennington: The 1980s' Most Decadent College,\" which describes \"the baroque wickedness, the malignant glamour, the corruption so profound as to be exactly what is meant by the word ''decadence.\"''<ref>Anolik, Lili. (2019, May 29). ''The Secret Oral History of Bennington: The 1980's Most Decadent College.'' Esquire. https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/a27434009/bennington-college-oral-history-bret-easton-ellis/</ref> This cements the connection of Donna Tartt and her alma mater to the precedents. Additionally, her androgyny, close friendships and rock-and-roll lifestyle are admired by the dark academic audience.<ref>http://web.archive.org/web/20210616200450/https://bondsmagii.tumblr.com/post/185454206997/physically-im-present-but-spiritually-im-at</ref> Its publication of 2019 also links this article to the rise in popularity c. 2020.  \n\nThe tag \"Dark Academia\" originated sometime around 2015 on tumblr and had a relatively smaller reach and referred to the main work that started the aesthetic: ''The Secret History''.<ref>metamorphoses (personal communication, May 31, 2021)</ref> The aesthetic resembled a book club more than a true aesthetic and users largely communicated through asks and reblogs to discuss the work itself, with less of an influence placed on fashion and lifestyle. Similar with other fandoms, the ''The Secret History'' fandom produced moodboards; however, they did not resemble the typical dark academia aesthetic, instead taking on a more minimalist look with photographic emphasis on symbols relating to characters, typography and fancasts.<ref>To see examples, check the Aesthetics Wiki Google Slide\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1hy1KXcdszTHfTGje5MyS3KrNiucrCCpGFt5973Hd7P8/edit?usp=sharing</ref>\n\nMultiple other fandoms also contributed to the development. Many of the visuals came from the ''Harry Potter'' series, which was popular at the time; the films' set design (largely from Oxford University), whimsy surrounding studying, leather-bound books and mystery are clear links to the dark academia aesthetic. \n\nMany of these blogs reblogged content from art history-centered tumblrs, which posted photos of architecture and paintings in the movements described in the visuals section. As bloggers discussed the media that has come to be associated with Dark Academia and multiple people posted art history content, the community formed and the name was created.\n\nThe name was popularized through 2017-2018 through a number of different text posts on tumblr; user holocene-days listed the three canonical Dark Academia films and books<ref>http://web.archive.org/web/20170425035918/https://holocene-days.tumblr.com/post/155874596482/the-holy-trinity-of-dark-academia-that-is-kill</ref>, saying, \"the holy trinity of dark academia that is kill your darlings, dead poets society, and the secret history.\" \n\nThe aesthetic evolved over time from an aesthetic that had a small community, was learned through osmosis and focused specifically on the media into what it was today. Dark Academia evolved in ways that the aesthetic was communicated; character collages became popular as people more in tune with online aesthetic culture, specifically [[Studyblr]], and the aesthetic became codified through different social media. In spreading to different audiences, the aesthetic became something more aspirational and lifestyle-oriented, with guides and recommendations instead of purely visuals to look at. \n\nOn June 30th, 2020, ''The New York Times'' published an article entitled \"Academia Lives \u2014 on TikTok,\" making Dark Academia, and the aesthetic community in general, known to an audience typically separate from online youth culture.<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/30/style/dark-academia-tiktok.html</ref>\n\n<br />\n\n== Philosophy ==\nOne of the main appeals of dark academia is intrigue that comes with being in a secretive cohort of intellectuals. \n\nRomanticizing the university experience and appreciating the environments and activities associated with Dark Academia (which is included below) is one of the most common motifs.   \n\n<br />\n== Visuals ==\nDark Academia as a whole utilizes the colors '''black, beige, dark brown, forest green, dark orange, cream, gold and burgundy'''. The photographs tend to be dimly lit, as to give the appearance of illumination through only candle light, a sun-less day, or light being unable to reach the interiors of a deep, alcove-filled room. As such, '''chiaroscuro and tenibrism''', the contrast between light and dark, is a common motif within images and outfits. White statues in the dark, pale skin (see Eurocentrism) contrasting dark clothing and the art movements described below are examples of this style. Often, photo editing is employed to increase the shadows of the image.\n\n'''[[Gothic]], Beaux-Arts and [[Classicism|Neoclassical]]''' architecture are featured frequently in dark academic images, as most of the '''prestigious campuses, museums and libraries''' were built in this style. Other common buildings are [[Baroque]] palaces that evoke masked balls (overlapping with dark [[Royalcore]]), English manor houses and [[Victorian]] streets. Red brick, rusticated stone, wrought iron fencing, Gothic arches, mahogany paneling, classical columns and generous ornamentation are common traits shared among these spaces. Some of the most common buildings reblogged are: the campuses of Harvard, Oxford and Cambridge; the Isabella Stewart Gardner museum; the Gloucester Cathedral; and the Victoria and Albert Museum.\n\nThe '''artworks''' utilized in dark academia come from the '''periods typically associated with European civilization''': Renaissance, [[Baroque]], Dutch Golden Age, [[Classicism|Neoclassical]], Academic, Romantic, Aesthetic and Pre-Raphaelite periods are the paintings that are the most commonly reblogged, with subjects such as architecture, landscapes, anatomical studies, vanitas, Christian and Classical mythology and portraiture of people wearing austere clothing. '''Etchings are incredibly common, as well as illustration and sketching'''. These have a benefit of having literary subjects, as these were often accompaniments to books.   \n\n'''Sculpture is always done in white marble''' and in the styles of Renaissance, Baroque and Neoclassical. Technique, such as in the illusion of flesh, psychological presence, diaphanous fabric and drapery, is admired.\n\nThe romanticization of studying, journaling and letter-writing is demonstrated through appreciation for '''calligraphy and stationary'''. Fountain pens and typewriters are proudly displayed and users would often take images of the results of their notebook entries, not unlike [[Studyblr]]. However, their writing is cursive and decorations are sparse.\n\n'''Images associated with''' '''literature''' are another common photo subject. Antique books, screenshots of e-books with highlighted lines, annotations and typography are common. Latin, ancient Greek, English and French are popular in dark academia both as subjects of linguistic study and in aesthetic images of text. A recent (around spring 2021) tumblr trend is the use of '''\"comparatives/parallels/web-weaving,\"'''  which are short compilations of 5-10 quotes and/or images from poetry, literature, art, movies, etc. that center around one motif such as \"the kitchen table\" and \"women and horror.\" Note that this type of post is not exclusive to Dark Academia, and is more aligned with fans of literature in general.   \n\n'''Nature''' may make an appearance in the aesthetic, mostly in the form of British moors, autumnal forests and occasional images of seaside cliffs. '''Dreary weather''' such as fog and rain enhances the gloomy nature of this aesthetic. This further adds to the romanticism of sneaking into the forest to do pagan rituals, as well as creating a connection to the poetry of the American Romantics. The influence of the Picturesque and the Sublime, as outlined in the work of Edmund Burke, is another aspect of this. This can overlap into an autumn Cottagecore blended aesthetic. \n\n'''Boarding school imagery''', such as school uniforms, living in a dormitory and running away, is more common in a more youthful and playful interpretation of the aesthetic. Here, the sense of mystery, danger and kinship are enhanced and the professionalism and sophistication connotations are lessened. \n\nCafe society is also another influence on the aesthetic. '''Coffee shops''' are associated with both the flaneurs of 19th-century Paris and the contemporary stressed college students of today. As such, that space is romanticized and images of coffee, people-watching and studying within the space is popular. \n\n'''Violent imagery''' addresses the \"dark\" moniker. Like in the novels and films, murder and death are popular subjects. This is displayed through murder weapons that are also aesthetically pleasing, i.e. vials of poison, ornate daggers and even occasional images of guns. Blood, such as on clothing or on white statues (bashing someone's head) is another example. Graveyards are also another location that is commonly reblogged due to the connotations with [[Gothic]] literature and memento mori.\n\nFor the purposes of citation, as well as a way to view inspiration, here is a link to the [https://web.archive.org/web/20210527082314/https://www.tumblr.com/tagged/dark+academia Wayback Machine's snapshots of the dark academia tag] on tumblr. \n\n<br />\n== Fashion ==\nDark Academia fashion emphasizes a high-class and vintage form of dress which is an amalgamation of different historical periods. The main inspiration for Dark Academic fashion comes from American Prep, such as sweater vests or sweaters worn tied over the shoulders. This itself came from 1940s prep school uniforms, as seen in blazers, pleated skirts and regimental striped ties. Stereotypes surrounding humanities professors also influenced the fashion. Tweed blazers with elbow patches are one of the \"essentials\" of a dark Academic wardrobe, as explained [https://www.chiraghapparel.com/blogs/thestylejournal/the-history-of-elbow-patches-and-their-relevance-today here]. Elements of the  Victorian and Romantic fashion are also influences on the more fanciful interpretation of the style, and create a Gothic novel character or eccentric dandy look. Autumn is the most common and desired season, as Dark Academia outfits often layer pieces over each other.  \n\nOne of the appeals of a Dark Academia wardrobe is the versatility of the pieces, as many of them could be mixed and matched. Like with school uniforms, this allows students/academics to not have to concern themselves too much with choosing their outfits in the day.<ref>A fashion class in the Dark Academics discord server</ref> Additionally, all of these clothes are commonly seen in a variety of stores, from thrift shops to in-person malls to designer brands. Searching for garments is thus easier, as it can fit multiple budgets and locales, as opposed to styles that have more specialized and alternative pieces that would be hard to find. \n\nUsual fabric choices are more upscale, like cashmere, wool and tweed, but linen and cotton are also very common. Patterns are minimal, with plaids and argyle being the most common.<br />\n\n[[File:Tumblr 6a25622fdda202d1e5d838f2954b3c50 8a71433a 640.jpg|thumb|267x267px|link=Special:FilePath/Tumblr_6a25622fdda202d1e5d838f2954b3c50_8a71433a_640.jpg|alt=]]\n\n*\n\n===Tops===\nThe shirts worn by Dark Academics can be masculine, '''professional button-ups''' or more '''ornate blouses''' that include details such as lace, puffed sleeves, and some ruffles. Collars are incredibly important to the look, and they often are either layered under sweaters or used as a statement, such as in sailor-style shirts. \n\n'''Sweaters''' are also important and contribute to the autumnal and bookish character of the wearer. '''Turtlenecks''' make the look more sexy and sophisticated, and sweaters provide '''an opportunity to add texture''' to an outfit in the form of cable-knit and embroidery.  \n\n[[File:Tumblr de1c5b8eaf6e37ea6464a5f2f58b721c 96fccb7c 640.jpg|thumb|265x265px|link=Special:FilePath/Tumblr_de1c5b8eaf6e37ea6464a5f2f58b721c_96fccb7c_640.jpg]]\n\n===Bottoms===\nPants in the Dark Academia aesthetic are always '''formal dress pants'''. They typically are in a sturdier material, such as tweed, and would sometimes feature patterns such as check and herringbone. Pleats are a common detail, and the fit around the ankles (flare, tapered, or straight) are up to personal preference. \n\nSkirts are also featured in more feminine outfits. '''Pleated and/or check-patterned skirts''' allude to prep school uniforms; '''mid-length or long flowing skirts''' have a more elegant and Victorian feel; and '''straight pencil skirts, often with button details''', make the look more mature and reference the 1930s-1940s. \n\n=== Dresses ===\nDresses are often worn as layering pieces. '''Pinafores and sleeveless dresses''' are often worn under turtlenecks or collared shirts. These can include the same details as skirts, and are more basic for the sake of layering, rather than as a statement. \n\nHowever, interpretations of Dark Academia that include [[Royalcore]] can include romantic ballgowns, and [[Cottagecore]] interpretations with Medieval-inspired milkmaid dresses. [[File:Tumblr 3bdd6b40ae71a843320841b027b60423 9db693cd 640.jpg|thumb|281x281px|link=Special:FilePath/Tumblr_3bdd6b40ae71a843320841b027b60423_9db693cd_640.jpg|alt=|tumblr user @my-darling-boy]]\n\n=== Outerwear===\nOuterwear is the most prominent feature of Dark Academic fashion because '''blazers, cardigans, and different kinds of coats''' are the most evocative of sophistication and professionalism. Outerwear is also extremely autumnal and an important feature of historical and vintage fashion in general. \n\nThe details in outerwear '''add texture and structure''' to an outfit. The fabrics used here are incredibly important, and tends to be of high-quality wool tweed. The '''fit of the outer layer is incredibly important because it makes the silhouette'''. In the community, it is largely either tailored to the wearer's body to look clean and professional or oversized to have a more cozy or chic look. \n\nThe type of outerwear worn with an outfit can greatly change the connotations and style associated with it. Like sweaters, cardigans can add texture and tends to be a softer and more casual interpretation of the aesthetic (especially if over-sized). Meanwhile, long coats, especially in black, add intimidating drama. Blazers, typically associated with men's businesswear, are the most common type of outerwear. \n\nThe '''sweater/cardigan can also be tied over shoulders''' to mimic the advertisements for American Prep brands. \n\n[[File:7c8449de6ae7cd7cc2ab9885c083641f.jpg|thumb|314x314px|link=Special:FilePath/7c8449de6ae7cd7cc2ab9885c083641f.jpg]]\n\n===Shoes===\nThe shoes tend to be '''leather men's dress shoes''' such as brogues and wing-tips. These match the timelessness and professionalism of the aesthetic and match the understated neurality of the other formal pieces. \n\nHowever, '''Doc Marten's black boots''' may be worn to add an edginess to the outfit. This brand is generally trending across many aesthetics throughout youth fashion in the 2020s, and its utilitarian nature make it avoid looking incongruous to the rest of the clothing. \n\nIn more feminine outfits, '''Mary-Janes or Victorian-esque footwear''' such as boots could be worn. These are '''typically matched with long socks''' to match other prep-school styled pieces such as pleated skirts. \n\n===Accessories===\nDark Academia tends to feature '''gender-neutral leather vintage and rectangular bags''' (mostly messenger bags). These match the professional aesthetic of formal outerwear and the utilitarian, no-frills versatility of the rest of the wardrobe. However, '''tote bags with an art print''' could be used for a more casual look while still fitting in with the aesthetic. \n\n'''Accessories that accompany suiting''' such as ties, pocket squares, and cufflinks are common. These should follow the same elegant and minimal aesthetic and fit the color palette. Unlike in some other outfits, such as in certain magazine editorials, these accessories aren't meant to stand out and add splashes of color that make it look daring.  \n\n'''Leather belts''' are an extremely popular component in Dark Academia outfits. It connects to vintage fashion, as this was generally worn throughout history, but lessened in popularity in more contemporary times as fashion became more casual. Likewise, '''suspenders''' have the same vintage connotation, but aren't as common in Dark Academia because of the popularity of sweaters.  \n\n'''Glasses''' match the aesthetic because of its association with bookishness. These are in classic and mature styles, such as in wire, dark metal, or tortoise shell frames.\n\nMore feminine outfits can feature jewelry, but this is understated and timeless, with simple gold and silver. '''Solid silver or gold pendants''' are especially common when worn with turtlenecks. '''Brooches''' are a common piece to add character flare to an outfit and are often cameos, skulls, insects, and other vintage things associated with the visuals. Rings, however, are an opportunity for exploring maximalism because many people '''stack different ring styles''' on top of each other.  \n\n=== Hair and Makeup ===\nThe hairstyles associated with the aesthetic are fairly loose in that '''multiple styles can fit,''' from neat bobs to long and disheveled. However, it is noted that alternative hairstyles, such as buzzed or dyed in unnatural colors tend to be left out from the aesthetic because of its incongruity with the vintage aesthetic.  \n\nThe makeup associated with Dark Academia should be either '''minimal and natural or mysterious, almost [[Femme Fatale|femme fatale]]-like'''. Natural (or no) makeup is associated with the more utilitarian and masculine forms of dress. The more obvious makeup follows the color palette of Dark Academia with burgundy lipstick and eyeshadow in grays and neutrals. Some common trends of contemporary makeup (heavy winged eyeliner, shimmer, contouring, etc.) tend to look mismatched to the more vintage type of fashion in the aesthetic and aren't used. \n\nLikewise, nails should be kept short and natural. <br />\n== Media ==\n<br />\n\n=== Canonical Literature ===\nDark Academia media tends to fall into two types: the first is media that is established as classic, also known as part of \"the canon,\" meaning that the work is considered by academics to have artistic merit and is worthy of academic study. These books tend to be from the Classical Era (such as the plays of Sophocles, philosophical theory, etc.) and Western literature up to the mid 20th century. Literature such as this does not include Dark Academia tropes, but are considered Dark Academia because it has the same associations with intelligence, refinement and would be studied in the setting. Note that what is classified as high literature is connected to critiques of Eurocentrism. For more information and a list of examples of books included, see the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_canon#Literary_canon Wikipedia entry on Western Canon]. <!-- Because the literary canon is extremely well-known and easily found, these authors and books will not be included in the list. -->\n\n=== Dark Academia Tropes ===\nThe second group is media that is not studied by academic professionals and may often be \"pop\" literature, which means it primarily seeks to entertain instead of create a philosophical dialogue. They are included here for having visuals and tropes that match the aesthetic.  \n\nWhat is considered Dark Academia media is largely subjective and there is not a set list of rules associated with the aesthetic. The media is recommended through [http://web.archive.org/web/20210705210220/https://www.tumblr.com/search/dark+academia+recommendations tumblr posts], [https://www.goodreads.com/search?q=dark+academia&search%5Bsource%5D=goodreads&search_type=lists&tab=lists Goodreads bookshelves], [https://letterboxd.com/search/dark+academia/ Letterboxd lists], etc.  \n\nThe Dark Academia community tends to read books or watch movies. Anime, plays, musicals and podcasts are included here for their resemblance to the aesthetic, rather than them being discussed in the community.\n\n==== Setting ====\nNovels (and films) that are considered Dark Academia take place in an academic setting, which includes high schools, boarding schools, and universities. These schools will have a prestigious reputation, with elements of exclusivity. The students would be of a higher socio-economic status, with mannerisms, clothing, and character concerns that reflect this.\n\nThe time period varies, but the 19th-mid 20th centuries are the most popular. The latter half of the 20th century to contemporary times would not include references to pop culture, technology, or the despairs typically associated with modern life (capitalism, consumerism, environmental destruction, etc.) This lack of modern technology may be one of the reasons why the contemprary audience is attracted to the genre- it is a form of escapism that allows the audience to be immersed in an environment that is extremely different from the quarantined audience of 2020.<ref>This was discussed in a book club in the Discord server Dark Academics. </ref>  \n\nThe academic setting would also influence the characters in that their subject of study would appear in allusions and character motivations. The subject is almost always of the humanities; for example, Shakespeare in ''If We Were Villains'' or the classics in ''The Secret History''. Knowledge is often esoteric and forbidden, creating a seductive allure.   \n\n==== Style ====\nThe most common traits among the media considered Dark Academia is the emphasis on prose. Elevated vocabulary, lavish detail, and insight into emotions and human character are paramount. Quotes are often shared among the community, making the work cemented as part of the Dark Academia \"canon.\"  \n\n==== Characterization ====\nHere are the common tropes and traits of dark academic-specific media, not canonical literature. Note that not all works below have all traits:<ref>This has been extrapolated from media that is the most frequent on dark academia lists such as ''The Secret History'', ''Frankenstein'' and ''Kill Your Darlings.'' The list of tropes should not be seen as an authority and this conversation varies amongst different members of the dark academia community.</ref>\n\n*Intelligence, Machiavellianism, coldness and elegance are common traits among the protagonists\n*A common character archetype is the \"Obsessive Artist,\" wherein someone dedicated to their study is willing to self-destruct or harm others for the sake of their work\n\n==== Plot and Motifs ====\n\n* The characters commit a crime- murder, more often than not\n* The characters keep secrets from each other and have intense interpersonal drama such as betrayal and blackmailing\n*Elements of esotericism and forbidden knowledge\n* Motifs of hedonism, temptation and hubris; similar to Shelley's ''Frankenstein'' wherein the character has a god complex due to their intelligence or ''Faust'', where the titular character trades knowledge for their soul.\n\n===Books===\nPlease do not list books by authors in the list below.

Specifically, the classical music used is wide-ranging, as Baroque (Bach, Vivaldi) and Romantic (Liszt, Tchaikovsky) is included. The classical music used in the aesthetic is typically in a tone more romantic, melancholy, epic, or severe, as it is played in the minor key and with piano and strings. \n\nContemporary alternative music is extremely popular, arguably more so than the classical and allows for the lyrics to carry across the motifs of romance, betrayal, mystery and crime. Classical allusions and metaphors with nature are also common techniques. There is a wide variety of instrumentation, although some common characteristics are: the use of strings or piano, slow and deep bass and backing or echoing vocals. Tempo tends to be slower and like in classical, has a more melancholy and contemplative tone. The genres that these songs fall into are alternative rock and indie. \n\nOn YouTube, it is popular to create videos that are playlists for studying, with the video showing an image with the Dark Academic aesthetic. Titles conveying the common tropes in the genre are common, for example, \"talking with the ghosts in an abandoned library.\"<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjjfXbWWtWg</ref> These playlists are a common entry for people into the aesthetic. The trend appeared in late 2020 and early 2021, as seen by the most popular videos being created approximately the same time.<ref>This was found by searching \"Dark Academia playlist\" on YouTube and sorting it through most viewed. Through this method, one can find that the top ten videos were created from November 2020 to January 2021. </ref> \n\n====Musicians====\n\n*Active Child\n*Alexander Scriabin\n*The Amazing Devil\n*Antonio Vivaldi\n*Arlie\n*The Aubreys\n*Barns Courtney\n*The Brobecks\n*Claude Debussy\n*Coast Modern\n*Crows in the Rain\n*The Decemberists\n*Declan McKenna\n*Dermot Kennedy\n*Enigma\n*Enya\n*Erik Satie\n*Fiona Apple\n*Florence + the Machine\n*Foxygen\n*Franz Liszt\n*Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin\n*Gerhard Trede\n*The Good, the Bad and the Queen\n*The Gothic Archies\n*Greer\n*Half Alive\n*Hans Zimmer\n*Hozier\n*Jaymes Young\n*Kate Bush\n*Keaton Henson\n*Lana Del Rey\n*Leonard Cohen\n*Lola Blanc\n*Lord Huron\n*Lorde\n*Ludwid van Beethoven\n*Missio\n*Mother Mother\n*Mumford and Sons\n*Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds\n*Nick Drake\n*Peter Gundry\n*Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky\n*Sergei Rachmaninoff\n*Sleeping At Last\n*Sufjan Stevens\n*Tally Hall\n*Tamino\n*Tori Amos\n*Vancouver Sleep Clinic\n*Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart\n*The Young Veins\n\n====Albums====\n\n*Violent Things by The Brobecks\n*We Are The 21st Century Ambassadors of Peace and Magic by Foxygen\n*The Tragic Treasury by The Gothic Archies\n*Wasteland, Baby! by Hozier\n*The Magic by Lola Blanc\n*In the Aeroplane Over the Sea by Neutral Milk Hotel\n*Boys For Pele by Tori Amos\n*Take a Vacation! by The Young Veins\n*Happier Than Ever by Billie Eilish\n*by the way, I forgive you by Brandi Carlile\n\n=== Playlist ===\n\n====[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/55prT8hZ47JDfKk3WkcDBW?si=a41b2651103f4c71&nd=1 Official Aesthetics Wiki playlist]====\nThe Aesthetics Wiki staff creates official Spotify playlists for aesthetics, which compile the songs most frequently featured on existing playlists dedicated to those aesthetics. Pages about aesthetics that have an official wiki playlist will not include other playlists.\n\n<br />\n\n*\n\n*\n\n==Activities==\nThe de facto Dark Academia activities are '''studying and reading'''. Learning about Dark Academia subjects (literature, languages, history, philosophy, etc.) is one of the ways that Dark Academia fans build community. Holding book clubs, recommending readings and discussing theory with peers is done through tumblr asks and reblogs, Discord servers and other social media sites. Solitary studying is more popular, however. Essay-writing, memorizing vocabulary and annotating literature are activities that are encouraged to pursue for fun. But unlike [[Studyblr]], less emphasis is placed on sharing studying tips and the scholastic experience. Rather, the subject or the emotions felt during studying is discussed. For example, as opposed to infographics on the advantages of different note-styles, Dark Academics wax poetically about the euphoria associated with finally mastering a language.   \n\nHowever, social situations such as parties and being within a group are more than encouraged. '''Being drunk and having engaging conversations''' is a popular wish for Dark Academics to have and why many people bond over this aesthetic. '''Dinner parties, coffee dates, and picnics''' in the forest are a frequent outlet for this, and wine, coffee, tea, bread, cheese, and upscale, traditional dishes are mentioned frequently in novels.      \n\n'''Supernatural experiences and loss of control''' are activities that are wished for (but not done due to their improbability). There are frequent mentions of the \"bacchanal,\" which was the inciting incident of ''The Secret History'', where the characters experienced divine madness through ritual.      \n\n'''Creative pursuits''' are also encouraged. Romanticism is linked with expressing emotions. Journaling, acting in theater, writing poetry and creating art are examples of this desire. What makes these activities \"fit\" the aesthetic is how closely it aligns with the patrician and academic class of the eras. For example, expressing oneself through rap music or making drip paintings would not be considered Dark Academic, but playing Chopin's Nocturnes or painting a naturalistic portrait of a lover would be.  \n\n'''Visiting buildings''' that fit the Dark Academia visuals, such as libraries, art museums, historic houses, churches, etc. is another way of experiencing the aesthetic. Existing and daydreaming in the space, taking note of the architecture and the people existing in it is in line with the romanticism of the ethos.

The boat in frame holds eight rowers and one coxswain. The regatta is taking place in front of a tree filled landscape]]'''Sports''' such as squash, horse riding, croquet and lacrosse can be claimed as Dark Academia due to their '''connection with [[Preppy]] culture'''. Multiple private schools' aspiring Ivy League students are encouraged to involve themselves with these sports in order to create a diverse skill set. And as described in the Preppy page, many of these sports are obscure and would not be accessed by an average person. \n\n'''Chess''' is one of the most connotative of dark academia due to its emphasis on strategy. As intellect and dramatic tension are two of the main pillars of the aesthetic's appeal. Chess has established itself as a sport done by calculating characters<ref>https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmartPeoplePlayChess</ref>, with its ubiquity throughout history<ref>https://www.britannica.com/topic/chess/History#ref80430</ref> fitting into the 19th-early 20th century aesthetic. Card games can have the same association. \n\nHobbies that are not necessarily intellectually or emotion-driven, but have the appearance of the aesthetic are also included. This includes '''calligraphy, book-binding and embroidery'''. The emphasis on improving oneself, dedication to a subject and active thinking and focus could be applied to these (and many more) hobbies. Again, what determines if a hobby could fit into the aesthetic is its resemblance to the visuals and connotations. '''The activities should fit the leisure class of the time periods.'''  \n\nFor comedy's sake, many Dark Academics '''banter about committing crimes''' such as murder, art theft, and blackmail.   \n\n<br />\n== Criticism ==\n\n=== Aestheticization of unhealthy behavior ===\nDark academia has been criticized for its apparent encouragement of unhealthy behavior in the pursuit of both the aesthetic itself and academic achievement.<ref>lil-bit-of-a-mess. (2020, December 1) [text post]. tumblr, archived on Wayback Machine. https://web.archive.org/web/20210610231557/https://lil-bit-of-a-mess.tumblr.com/post/636320046655881216/listen-i-love-dark-academia-i-really-do-it</ref><ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20210610231229/https://sonderstudy.tumblr.com/post/190984411818/my-two-cents-on-dark-academia</ref> Stress and procrastination related to education, depression and its symptoms, unhealthy sleep habits, including both under and oversleeping and excessive consumption of coffee, are frequently referenced and discussed in dark academic communities.\n\n=== Western Eurocentrism ===\nDark academia focuses predominantly on languages, literature, architecture, art, poetry and fashion originating from Western Europe and has been consequently criticized as Eurocentric. Many dark academics have rejected an exclusionary interpretation of dark academia and encouraged academics to include non-Western languages, literature, architecture and clothing in their conceptions and use of the aesthetic.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20210316000025/https://sappylittlebitch.tumblr.com/post/620401404176154624/cultural-dark-academia</ref><ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20210607212258/https://punkenglishnerd.tumblr.com/post/189453466668/to-all-the-people-saying-can-i-still-be-a-dark</ref><ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20210607213344/https://ataphya.tumblr.com/post/645623340466339840/also</ref>\n\n=== Lack of True Academic Thought ===\nAnother criticism of Dark Academia does not lie in its socio-political issues, but rather that Dark Academics are not necessarily intellectual, and overly emphasize the aesthetic, rather than actually participate in academic work. Many, if not most, of the works included in the Dark Academia canon are pop literature, often from the young adult genre. So, some literature fans are exasperated when Dark Academics assume a persona of being intellectual and sophisticated, when the novels they read do not express the same literary quality as more rigorous novels do.   \n\nThe use of books being a point for fashion and lifestyle inspiration without much emphasis on critical thought is another contention. This is especially true with appreciation for ''The Secret History'', which is supposed to be a satire- people trying to mimic their lifestyle and personality of the characters are missing the point of the novel mocking the main characters.<ref>http://web.archive.org/web/20210803185504/https://frogandtoadpdf.tumblr.com/post/620950992040673280/frogandtoadpdf-the-secret-history-is-fight-club</ref> Many books demonstrate that pretentiousness and isolation from non-academics create hubris, leading to the characters' downfalls; readers who understand the theme would be less inclined to assume these relationship dynamics, presumably.  \n\nAdditionally, many critics claim that Dark Academia is more preoccupied with the visual aesthetic rather than studying and academia itself. Rather than enjoying studying and reading because of the subject matter/themes, some critics say that these people are more preoccupied with projecting the aesthetic of being sophisticated, in affect being posers.    \n\nFans of the aesthetic also, entirely inadvertantly, changed the semantic meaning behind academia as an amorphous class that includes the poor, people of color, and a variety of cultures to an aesthetic that emphasizes Western Eurocentricism and classicism, with a set lifestyle and mode of thought. From this, people will continue seeing academia as a group of pretentious ivory tower types instead of the diversity of the class. Anti-intellectualism and a lack of class solidarity results from this misconception of academia, and the aesthetic may perpetuate this view to the generation on social media.<ref>http://web.archive.org/web/20210801203844/https://fakeblondeabigailhobbs.tumblr.com/post/636700069549260800/finelythreadedsky-finelythreadedsky-the</ref> \n\n<br />\n==Resources==\nExternal links to help get a better understanding of this aesthetic.\n\n=== Communities ===\n\n*[https://blackhholesbooks.wordpress.com/2020/05/22/litcrit-dark-academia-revisited/ LitCrit: Dark Academia revisited]\n*[https://i-d.vice.com/en_uk/article/xgqn5d/dark-academia-is-the-latest-teen-internet-trend-on-tiktok Vice: Dark Academia is the witchy literary aesthetic sweeping TikTok]\n*[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_academia Wikipedia: Dark Academia]\n*[https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2020/7/7/21315213/cottagecore-tiktok-dark-academia Vox: This week in TikTok: Are you cottagecore or more \u201cdark academia\u201d?]\n*[https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/30/style/dark-academia-tiktok.html New York Times: Academia Lives \u2014 on TikTok]\n\n==== Reddit ====\n\n*[https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkAcademia/ /r/DarkAcademia]\n*[https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkAcademiaLibrary/ /r/DarkAcademiaLibrary]\n\n====Discord Servers====\n\n*[https://discord.gg/rWxyP9F Dark Academics (16+)]\n\n== Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" widths=\"130\" orientation=\"none\" navigation=\"true\" bordercolor=\"#000000\">\nDa fighter.jpg|An Instagram post by Sydney Decker (@myfairesttreasure).\nDesk.jpg\nJane austen and satchel.jpg\nDa style.jpg\nFashion with coffee.jpg\nKill your darlings.jpg|'''Kill Your Darlings''' (2013)\nDead poets society.jpg|'''Dead Poets Society''' (1989)\nThe picture of dorian gray.jpg\nMoody statues.jpg\nBoy looking at painting.jpg\n1t5v5enz0p621.jpg|A dark academia moodboard by Instagram user @d.ontletmedown.\nEEMXKdfWsAEBgpU.jpg\nTumblr 897d300b085be21eead346e6fb030c52 70f7db64 1280.jpg\nAsdftygvuhbnj.jpg\nAn Aspiring Dark Academic.png\nEm BLM on Twitter.png\nDark academia Tumblr.jpeg\nDark academic school boys.jpg\nDark academia aesthetic 7.jpg\nDark academia aesthetic 8.jpg\nFile:Dark academia putti.jpg\nDark academia aesthetic 9.jpg\nDa outfits.png\n2BF5C22D-3E4D-46EA-9BD0-68E1C8A53B5B.jpeg\n6837E88F-2D2D-47DA-BDC4-388AD4149449.jpeg\nFile:Dark academia mural.png\nF1FBE757-5C98-4AB7-8177-D119F4B19020.png\nFile:Dark academia cloister.jpg\nTypewriters.jpg\n2021-01-08 (13).png|Carpe Diem | '''Dead Poets Society'''\nDark Academia-Statue and Bookshelf.webp\nFile:Da primavera.jpg\nDark Academia-Bookself and Ladder.webp\n116 mondscheinsonate im stehen.jpg|link=https://www.pinterest.de/pin/345299496438312477/\nFile:Dark academia cemetary.jpg\nFile:Da ophelia.jpg\nFile:Da manor.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n== References and notes ==\nAll references marked with personal communication are interviews.
