Bubblegum Bitch was strongly influenced by 2000s American pop culture, and takes some visual and philosophical inspiration from [[McBling]].  \n\nA point of confusion is parody artwork and clothing featuring cartoon characters like Hello Kitty or Barbie but using swear words or referencing sex. Because of this, these things are not technically [[Sanriocore]] or [[Barbiecore]], but in fact Bubblegum Bitch.\n== Fashion ==\nBubblegum bitch fashion generally uses highly saturated colors, particularly pink, purple, and white, and stereotypically feminine style. Fashion sometimes features typically \"innocent\" and/or pretty characters like the Bratz Dolls, Powerpuff Girls, Jigglypuff, Hello Kitty, Barbie, My Little Pony characters, and various others. Typically \"childish\" accessories and accents like barrettes, glitter, hair ties, and candy jewelry are sometimes used. These are often paired with more serious and adult style choices, like chokers, chains, swear words, statements relating to politics, mental health, romance, and sex.  \n\n=== Clothing ===\n\n*Pink clothing\n* Iridescent clothing\n* Glittery clothing\n* Tulle\n* Clothing featuring innocent, pretty characters (which are often targeted towards children)\n* Clothing with words or statements\n* Tank tops\n* Crop tops\n* Dyed and stylized jean jackets\n* Mini-skirts\n* Knee socks\n* Heeled shoes\n* Stilettos\n\n=== Accessories ===\n\n*Sunglasses\n* Chokers\n* Children's watches\n*Earrings\n* Barrettes\n*Hair bows\n*Acrylic nails\n*Wigs and extensions\n\n=== Stores ===\n\n* Victoria\u2019s Secret\n* DollsKill\n* Fila\n\n=== Makeup ===\n\n*Glitter\n* Lipstick\n* Lip gloss\n* Tattoos, temporary or not\n*Winged eyeliner\n*False eyelashes\n*Dyed hair and/or highlights\n\n== Visual ==\n\n=== Colors ===\nPink is the most significant color in the Bubblegum Bitch aesthetic.\n\n*[[Red]]\n*[[Pink]]\n** Hot pink\n** Light pink\n*[[White]]\n*[[Black]]\n\n==== Pastel colors ====\n\n*[[Blue]]\n*[[Yellow]]\n*[[Cyan]]\n*[[Purple]]\n\n=== Textures and patterns ===\n\n* Bubbles\n* Confetti\n* Glitter\n* Gold\n* Tulle\n*Fruit patterns like strawberries and cherries\n*Dots\n** Heart-shaped dots\n** Star-shaped dots\n** Polka dots\n\n=== Objects ===\nThis is a list of object visuals associated with the bubblegum bitch aesthetic:\n\n* Anime art\n* Pink\n* Hearts\n* Bubblegum\n* Candy\n* Sweet foods\n* Stylized profanity\n* Stylized quotes\n* Children's toys, especially toys marketed toward young girls\n* Children's TV shows and characters such as Hello Kitty, Jigglypuff, and The Powerpuff Girls\n* Bold fonts\n* Hair bows\n* Clouds\n* Glitter\n* Records\n* Rollerskating and rollerblading\n* Crystals\n* Balloons\n* Flowers\n*Bratz Dolls\n*Cherries\n*Strawberries\n\n== Media ==\nBubblegum Bitch media is more jaded and sexual than [[Barbiecore]] but it lacks the hard partying and drug culture of [[McBling]].\n\n=== Movies ===\n\n*''Grease'' (1978)\n*''Heathers'' (1988)\n*''Jawbreaker'' (1999)\n*''Uptown Girls'' (2003)\n*''D.E.B.S.''
