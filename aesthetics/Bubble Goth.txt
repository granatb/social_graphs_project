She aims to \"make the beautiful, creepy and the creepy, beautiful\", something that \"takes light and dark and puts them together\".\n\nKerli created this type since she was labeled as Goth when she published her \"Love is Dead\" album, Walking on Air being a particularly popular song to pin her to the subculture with. \n\n== Visual ==\n\n=== Boards ===\n[https://www.pinterest.com/KelsSwas/bubble-goth/ Bubble Goth] by Kelsey Swasey\n\n[https://www.pinterest.com/rezendesrb/bubble-goth/ Bubble Goth] by Rin Rezendes\n\n== Fashion ==\n\n* Face masks (especially gas masks)\n* Dramatic goth inspired makeup, heavily focused on the eyes\n* White or black as the primary outfit colour\n* Lots of accessories\n* Space buns\n* Three dots representing I.

The music of this type are things like Kerli's work; pop or techno music with a more morbid, edgy or dark feel.\n\nDespite the \"Goth\" label, the music does not seem to be inspired by, or have any correlation with, actual goth music. Kerli's music could instead be considered a type of dark pop.\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery widths=\"185\">\nKERLI - SAVAGES (official music video)\nBubble Goth.jpg\nBubbleGoth.jpg\nBubble_goths.jpg\nBubbles.jpg\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Goth Suffix]]\n[[Category:Fashion]]\n[[Category:Visual]]\n[[Category:Music]]\n[[Category:Estonian]]\n[[Category:Feminine]]\n[[Category:Sexy]]"}}}]}}}}
