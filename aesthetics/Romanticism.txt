The movement developed in reaction against the rationalism of the [https://www.bl.uk/restoration-18th-century-literature/articles/the-enlightenment Enlightenment], and later on, against the materialism of the Industrial Revolution.\n\n\n\nRomanticism, at its heart, values: nature, emotionality, subjectivity, and individuality. But above all, the Romantic strives towards the enigmatic ideal of the \"sublime\". Because Romanticism is so idealistic, it often aligns itself with Nationalism which is why the traits and visual tropes of Romanticism vary from country to country. However, this fascination with national ideals often resulted in a Romantic fertilization of non-western/European societies and cultures.   \n== Fashion ==\nNineteenth century Romantics generally wore their hair longer than the squares of the day, and would have probably worn more typically androgynous clothing. Their wardrobe consisted of silk scarves, looser jackets and pantaloons, straw hats, and a walking stick\u2014seeing as the Romantic loves to hike and walk through nature. \n\nHowever, the Romantic ideal of the young genius resulted in a trend towards looking sickly. Romantics often wanted to look consumptive\u2014that is to say flushed and thin\u2014and worshipped the premature deaths of Romantic poet John Keats (who died at the age of 25) and composer Frederic Chopin (who was 39), both of tuberculosis. \n\n== Texts ==\n[[File:Lord George Byron (1788-1824). .jpg|thumb|356x356px|The Poet Lord George Byron (1788-1824). ]]\nThe Key Texts of Romanticism: \n\n'''Early Romantic Texts''' \n\n* ''[https://www.gutenberg.org/files/9622/9622-h/9622-h.htm Lyrical Ballads]'' (1798) by Samuel Taylor Coleridge and William Wordsworth. \n* ''[https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45542/the-prelude-book-1-childhood-and-school-time The Prelude]'' (1799) by William Wordsworth. \n* ''[https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1934/1934-h/1934-h.htm Songs of Innocence and Experience]'' (1794) by William Blake. \n\n'''Second Generation Romantic Texts'''\n\n* ''[https://www.gutenberg.org/files/21700/21700-h/21700-h.htm Don Juan]'' (1819) by Lord George Byron. \n* ''[https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43844/she-walks-in-beauty She Walks in Beauty]'' (1814) by Lord George Byron. \n* ''[https://www.gutenberg.org/files/3268/3268-h/3268-h.htm The Mysteries of Udolpho]'' (1794) by Ann Radcliffe. \n* ''[https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44477/ode-on-a-grecian-urn Ode on a Grecian Urn]'' (1820) by John Keats \n* ''[https://www.gutenberg.org/files/84/84-h/84-h.htm Frankenstein]'' (1823) by Mary Shelley. \n\n'''Russian Romantic Texts''' \n\n* ''[https://www.gutenberg.org/files/913/913-h/913-h.htm A Hero of Our Time]'' (1840) by Mikhail Lermontov. \n* ''[https://www.gutenberg.org/files/23997/23997-h/23997-h.htm Eugene Onegin]'' (1830) by Alexander Pushkin. \n\n'''French Romantic Texts''' \n\n* ''[https://www.gutenberg.org/files/135/135-h/135-h.htm Les Miserables]'' (1862) by Victor Hugo. \n* ''[https://digital.library.upenn.edu/women/sand/indiana/indiana.html Indiana]'' (1832) by George Sand. \n\n<br />\n\n== Music ==\nThe cumulative Romantic musical form is the symphony\u2014a form of music dependent on subjective experience and emotions. \n\n* Basics of Romantic classical music: https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7qXaPjzDlR7cbsweXbH0tu (by Spotify user pomooney). \n\n'''Romantic Composers'''\n[[File:Frederic Chopin by Eugene Delacroix. .jpg|thumb|233x233px|Frederic Chopin by Eugene Delacroix. ]]\n\n* Ludwig Van Beethoven (https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DX12YIlzNkccL).  \n* Frederic Chopin (https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DWV7cvDzE3MOI). \n* Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky (https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DX2kvBlhyEkb6). \n* Franz Liszt (https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DX93wmY669mVj). \n* Franz Schubert (https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DWY3VlkBR4Jhb). \n* Hector Berlioz (https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DWWq1x4amZ5Ls).  \n\n<br />\n\n== Subgenres ==\n\n=== Dark Romanticism ===\n'''Dark Romanticism''' is a subgenre of Romanticism,\n<nowiki> </nowiki>reflecting popular fascination with the irrational, the demonic and the\n<nowiki> </nowiki>grotesque.
