It tends to also cross over with other dark aesthetics, like [[Dark Academia]], [[Crowcore]], and [[Vulture Culture]].\n\n==Visual==\nThe things that differentiate Cottagegore from Cottagecore include:\n\n*Rain and fog\n*Poisonous plants and mushrooms\n*Thunderstorms\n*Thorn bushes\n*Carnivorous plants\n*Dark fairy tales\n*Tornadoes\n\nThere also tends to be less of an emphasis on the farming aspect that is often seen in regular Cottagecore and has more of a Witchy/Esoteric vibe to it, like a witch living out in the middle of the woods, cut off from civilization, and only relying on her coven of fellow witches to get by in the harsh elements of mother nature. Cottagegore has a reverence for mother nature as a force and an entity that can be incredibly destructive.\n\n==Fashion==\nCottagegore tends to take the Cottagecore fashion aesthetic and runs it through more of a [[Goth|Gothic]] lens. The fashion consists of black flouncy dresses, black overalls, and old black clothing that can be worn while living a quiet, solitary farm life.\n\n==Media==\n===Television===\n*Alias Grace\n*Ratched\n*The Queens Gambit\n*A Series of Unfortunate Events\n*The Haunting of Bly Manor\n*Over The Garden Wall\n\n===Movies===\n*Antrum (2018)\n*The Cabin in the Woods (2011)\n*Children of the Corn (1984)\n*Eden Lake (2008)\n*Evil Dead II (1987)\n*The Farm (2018)\n*Gretel & Hansel (2020)\n*Hatchet (2006)\n*It Comes at Night (2017)\n*Mama (2013)\n*Motel Hell (1980)\n*Pan's Labyrinth (2006)\n*Signs (2002)\n*The Blair Witch Project (1999)\n*The Forest (2016)\n*The Ritual (2015)\n*The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974)\n*The Visit (2015)\n*The Witch (2015)\n*Wrong Turn (2021)\n\n===Books & Manga===\n*The Girl From the Other Side\n\n===Music===\n====Spotify Playlists====\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1wxd57G1ErIFJOEaynRwBN witchy cottagecore by sarah]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/41Mys1GC5uTVs6DayqQHna forest academia (dark cottagecore) by \ud83c\udf33\ud83c\udf3f\ud83c\udf44]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0hvbl5PA84bks7sBe8grTD Dark Cottagecore\ud83c\udf32\ud83e\uddfa\ud83d\udda4\ud83c\udf3e\ud83e\ude90 by eden fawn]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5zD3ZnWcORc8YrDoek4uUn cottagegore (dark cottagecore) by Kester] \n\n====YouTube songs====\n*[https://youtu.be/FPZE5SvBTx4 Grandma's Catacombs by Grandma's Catacombs]\n*[https://youtu.be/tHgqkHJlWZI Moss Golem - The House That Grandma Built]\n\n==== Youtube playlists ====\n\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lwSD8UXdW4 \ud835\udd88\ud835\udd94\ud835\udd99\ud835\udd99\ud835\udd86\ud835\udd8c\ud835\udd8a\ud835\udd8c\ud835\udd94\ud835\udd97\ud835\udd8a \ud83e\udd40\ud83d\udd2a\ud83c\udf44 (dark cottagecore cassette mixtape)]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qSFQinHdys a cottagegore playlist for the shadows you encountered in the forest]\n\n<br />\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"130\" spacing=\"small\" orientation=\"landscape\">\nEFB7124F-1A0E-4A48-9F05-A4D826B9C94A.jpeg\n23A389A0-1D8A-4AE6-8A2E-FBDD41AC9677.jpeg\nPretty moss cottage.PNG\n96C398D2-894B-489E-9254-89C684F22847.jpeg\n82893039-455E-447D-99A2-31DDF07D4A5D.jpeg\nWolf in forest.jpg\n4c9ca30a08dc3206d3da4cf9b4abc3db.jpg\nWitchMarks.jpg\nFoggy swamp.jpeg\nFoggy moss forest.jpeg\nTumblr 7ef8b7821dd93abba1b99a5fa1c56dcc 5e7c93f8 2048.png\nTumblr fc6052b2812d2d7a73b8cf49cc1523b1 2e9bf327 2048.jpg\nE509508B-ED29-4DAD-8841-4DFC6953FDE5.jpeg\nFoggy Deer in Field.jpg\nGray Trees.jpg\nFile:81282172-C788-4D3E-9C42-49D3228BEDFC.jpeg\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Visual]]\n[[Category:Fashion]]\n[[Category:Fields and forests]]"}}}]}}}}
