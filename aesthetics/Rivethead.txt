Industrial music was started by the band Throbbing Gristle, which ended up forming a genre that is noisy and abrasive, combining rock and electronica.<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rivethead</ref>\n==Music==\nThe rivethead scene is remotely related but not directly connected to the industrial music culture.\u00a0Industrial music\u00a0is a genre of experimental and avant-garde music, intertwined with graphical visualization (mostly with disturbing graphical content). The absence of conventional song structures, such as rhythm and melody, is a main characteristic of the genre, whereas the music preferred by the rivethead scene includes several danceable and song-oriented styles that are sometimes considered\u00a0''\"post-industrial\"''.\u00a0Like\u00a0post-punk, the term\u00a0post-industrial\u00a0describes a musical genre that developed distinctly from its roots and turned into several strands of sound, namely\u00a0electro-industrial,\u00a0electronic body music, and\u00a0industrial rock, often referred to as\u00a0industrial dance music. Those styles differ from traditional industrial music regarding aesthetics, sound, and production techniques.\n\n'''Below are some Industrial genres:'''\n\n*'''Industrial''' is the original genre formed by Throbbing Gristle. Industrial takes a lot of inspiration from noise genres, with rather unconventional methods such as recording with raw materials, white noise and heavy synthesizer use. \n*'''Industrial Rock''' Includes Skinny Puppy, Nine Inch Nails, Chemlab\n*'''[https://everynoise.com/engenremap-industrialmetal.html Industrial Metal]''' is the combination of Industrial with Metal. As such, Industrial Metal is the most loud and aggressive of the subgenres. Industrial Metal saw huge success in the 90s and early 2000s, with acts such as Marylin Manson, Powerman 5000, White/Rob Zombie and more.\n**'''[https://everynoise.com/engenremap-neuedeutscheharte.html Neue Deutsche Harte]''' is described as an offshoot of Industrial Metal, combining it with other forms of metal such as alternative metal or groove metal. NDH formed in countries such as Germany and Austria, hence the German-name, which translates to \"new German hardness\". NDH's most prominent feature is the accentuation of certain words or notes- which gives a song an unorganized but punchy sound- and mostly deep, growling male vocals. The most well known NDH bands are Rammstein and KMFDM.\n*'''Electro-Industrial/Aggrotech''' with aggro being slightly more modern, when aggressive industrial rhythms meets techno, very dancey and sometimes crosses over with Neue Deutsche Harte\n*'''EBM''' Kind of like EDM but extra textured sound, usually very sensual\n*'''Rhythmic Noise/Powernoise''' A huge risk for getting tinnitus\n\n=== Bands ===\n* Chemlab\n* KMFDM\n* Marilyn Manson\n* Ministry\n* Nine Inch Nails\n* Powerman 5000\n* Rammstein\n* Skinny Puppy\n*Front 242\n\n==Fashion ==\nRivethead fashion is heavily inspired by [[Military]] fashion.\n\n===<u>Male</u>===\n\n*'''Tops''': Black, grey, or olive\u00a0tank tops,\u00a0plain\u00a0t-shirts, band shirts, sleeveless shirts (sometimes with the sleeves ripped off),\u00a0tie-dye\u00a0crinkle or burst pattern shirts; black\u00a0leather jackets (frequently painted with band\u00a0logos), and MA-1\u00a0flight jackets.\n*'''Pants''':\u00a0Cargo\u00a0and\u00a0BDU\u00a0paratrooper pants, ripped jeans, vintage shorts, often but not always black or\u00a0Woodland camouflage; usually tucked into boots, rolled at the bottom, cuffs or worn as cut-off shorts.
