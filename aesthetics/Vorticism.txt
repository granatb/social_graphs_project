It aimed to create art that expressed the dynamism of the modern world. \u00a0It was originally created in London by the writer and artist Wyndham Lewis back in 1914. Although it was based in London, it was international in make-up and ambition.\n\n== Purpose ==\nVorticism's purpose was for Wyndham to share the abstract art of other artists. This art was shared in museums and was also shown in BLAST magazine. There were eleven participants in this. Their names were:\n\n* Richard Aldington\n* Malcolm Arbuthnot\n* Lawrence Atkinson\n* Jessica Dismorr\n* Henri Gaudier-Brzeska\n* Cuthbert Hamilton\n* Wyndham Lewis\n* Ezra Pound\n* William Roberts\n* Helen Saunders\n* Edward Wadsworth \n\nThese artists got together to share their art with the world. Although this did not last long, they were congratulated for going outside the box with their creations.\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery widths=\"110\" spacing=\"small\" orientation=\"square\">\nKinda reminds me of liminal spaces.jpg\nFunny shapes.jpg\nEdward Wadsworth, Liverpool Shipping, 1918.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n[[Category:Art]]\n[[Category:Needs work]]\n[[Category:Visual]]\n[[Category:Art movements]]\n[[Category:Ism suffix]]"}}}]}}}}
