It could be argued that green academia is similar to goblincore in its love of nature, collecting trinkets, and fashion, but green academia is more intellectual and scientific. \n\nAlthough social sciences are emphasized less in green academia than in other academic aesthetics, philosophy, natural history, and environmental sociology are featured in various forms throughout green academia media. Arts including poetry, sculpture, and drawing are popular in green academia text posts and images.\n\nLike in other academia aesthetics, the pursuit of knowledge and appreciation of scientific study are valued highly in green academia.\n\n==Activities==\nSpending plenty of time outside is as important as studying and reading. Natural philosophers may frequently collect rocks and gemstones, skulls, and books. They also like to do some things in an old-fashioned way, so you're likely to find ink and quills on their desks. They may also have a library and a collection of letters of their correspondence with minded beings. Both indoor and outdoor plants are popular as decoration and subjects of study. Natural philosophers tend to study in solitude but connecting with like-minded people is also great. They will write letters or go on a hike together. Plants are good companions but also a range of animals such as dogs, cats, and small critters.
