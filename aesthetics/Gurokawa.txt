Gurokawa is appealing because up until its creation many people haven't really seen a world where cute things are cruel. Bloodstains, dripping blood, bats, ghosts, and all kinds of monsters are a common visual theme. <ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20180129002133/http://www.rokkyuu.com/fashion/designer-gashicon-on-graphics-and-gurokawa-style/ Designer Gashicon on Graphics and Gurokawa Style - Rokkyuu Magazine (archive) ]<br /></ref>   \n\n<br />\n\n=== Gloomy Bear ===\nGloomy bear is a cute-looking but violent pink bear that eats humans. The character was created by illustrator Mori Chack. Gloomy is a little over 6 feet tall and weighs as much as 2,000 pomegranates. Owned by human Pitty, he\u2019s well trained for the most part, but he can never remember that he\u2019s not supposed to attack humans. Still, a pet owner must take ultimate responsibility for his pets. Recalling warm memories of Gloomy as a cute cub, Pitty tries to lead a life of peaceful co-existence with his pet bear.\n\n=== Eyeballs ===\nEyeballs as motifs and accessories are popular within the gurokawa fashion and other similar fashions such as decora. Popularised by music and fashion icon Kyary Pamyu Pamyu, who often features them in her outfits and music videos. Eyeballs can be seen on prints, hair accessories, and jewelery.\n\n== Fashion ==\nThe style revolves around horror and gore, with a goth or pastel spin to it. Outfits are usually very casual with a focus on prints, and often feature eyeballs and other human body parts as accessories. Fake blood is commonly used not only for the clothes, but also parts of the make-up.\n\n== Media ==\n\n=== TV Shows ===\n\n* Bludgeoning Angel Dokuro-chan\n*Gloomy The Naughty Grizzly\n* Happy Tree Friends\n*Jashin-chan Dropkick\n\n=== Manga ===\n\n* A-ko-chan no Beautiful Cinema\n* Cinderalla-chan\n* Little Fluffy Gigolo PELU\n* Hell Ladies\n* Ningyo Himeden\n* Pure Trance\n* Yojouhan Yousei Zukan\n\n== Music ==\n'''Artists'''\n\n* Hangry & Angry\n*Kyary Pamyu Pamyu\n*Shiina Pikarin\n*Jazmin Bean\n* Namakopuri\n\n== Resources ==\nExternal links to help get a better understanding of this aesthetic.\n\n=== Vendors ===\n\n*[https://acdcrag.com/en ACDC RAG]\n*[https://brokendolljapan.ocnk.net/ Broken Doll Japan]\n*[http://goregro.cart.fc2.com/ Goregro]\n*[https://hypercore.theshop.jp/ Hypercore]\n*[https://store.kreepsville666.com/ Kreepsville 666]\n*[https://shop.nier.tokyo/ NieR Tokyo]\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" widths=\"135\">\nC0Rmh4kVIAAhNd3.jpg\nCFvHmo3VEAAKHCL.jpg\nW.jpg\n2fi7gm-l-610x610-jewels-lolita-pastel-pastel-goth-pastel-grunge-gothic-gothic-lolita-goth-pink-dress-eyeball-hairbow-hair-bow-hair-accessory.jpg\nW850.jpg\n005F2NGAly1gpn0x1r2cyj31ha1z4b29.jpg\nO0640048013754069009.jpg\n20130914 770982.jpg\nKyary pamyu pamyu ponponpon.jpg\nO0480064013754063051.jpg\n4365365.jpg\n11.jpg\nGloomy.png\n80F6450F-DC6D-4EE9-87B6-E443473A4F20.jpeg\nTumblr oh7fcj5yJ61vaf4n3o1 1280.jpg\nFile:3.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n== References ==\n<references /><br />\n[[Category:Visual]]\n[[Category:Fashion]]\n[[Category:Japanese]]\n[[Category:Needs work]]\n[[Category:Feminine]]\n[[Category:Cute]]\n[[Category:Creepy]]"}}}]}}}}
