The aesthetic also holds onto a degree of melancholy, tying back into its original creation for the Neurodivergent community and the stigma/misunderstanding that often comes with it. Changelingcore was originally coined by (now-deactivated) Tumblr user willow-o-the-wisp as a subcategory of Faecore that is exclusively for Neurodivergent people, for example, people who are Autistic, or who have ADHD, DID, etc.\n\n\n\n\n==Visual==\n\n*Being barefoot\n*Fairy rings\n*Big heavy coats\n*Moss\n*Collections (Possibly strange)\n*Uncanny valley\n*Cute things with a hint of eeriness (i.e. a teddy bear with too many eyes)\n* Liminal Spaces\n*Comfort Object/s that you take everywhere\n*Homemade Jewelry\n*Doodles everywhere and anywhere\n*Clutter\n*Stimming!\n*Shiny things/ Shinies\n*Stompy Shoes\n*Eccentric outfits with lots of layers\n* Dark waters\n\n==Activities ==\n\n*Going to the woods/the sea/hilltops/paddock muttering a phrase or counting under your breath the entire way there.
