Not always used in a positive way. The words are constantly used in songs, often those consumed by so called agrogirls/agroboys.\nIts origin is usually credited to the mixture between Brazilian country culture and Brazilian 2000s urban culture. The aesthetic was became popular by the rise of Sertanejo music and Forr\u00f3 music for university students due to many people born in the countryside moving to urban contexts for education and work opportunities. Those people were usually sons and daughters of well heeled property owners, they didn't want to let go of their traditions but have the dream and money to adapt to \"big city ways\". Eventually, the aesthetic spread back to the actual farm fields, probably due to those people coming back home.\n\n==Materials and Fabric Patterns==\n\n*Leather\n*Denim\n*Plaid\n*Bandana\n*Gold\n*Straw\n*Lace (Mostly black and only on women)\n\n==Fashion Items==\n\n* Cowboy hats (especially made from straw)\n*Tight Jeans (sometimes ripped)\n*Cross necklaces\n* Polo shirts\n*Button-ups (Often plaided)\n*Belts\n*Leather boots\n*Vest (often with nothing under them)\n*Tank top\n*Deep \"v\" neckline (usually for women, but not exclusive)\n*Big earings (for women)\n\n==Hair ==\n\n====Common Colours====\n\n*Blond highlights\n*Light brown\n*Dark brown\n\n====Styling====\nEither very long and straight (usually for women but also seen on men) or very short and shaved on the sides (usually seen on men, but not exclusively).\n<br />\n\n==Notable Influencers==\n\n* Mar\u00edlia Mendon\u00e7a\n*Gusttavo Lima\n* Wesley Safad\u00e3o\n*Maiara e Maraisa\n*Chit\u00e3ozinho & Xoror\u00f3\n* Michel Tel\u00f3\n*Luan Santana\n*Henrique e Juliano\n*Alex Ferrari\n\n====[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1082o5fC8w5wveUxiA4FA8 Example playlist]====\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\n\nFile:Agroboyy.jpg|Agroboy\nFile:Agroboy.jpg|Agroboy\nFile:Agrogirl.jpg|Agrogirl\nFile:Style agrogirl.jpg|Agrogirl\n\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Music]]\n[[Category:Fashion]]\n[[Category:Tradition]]\n[[Category:Brazilian]]\n[[Category:Needs work]]\n[[Category:Social Movements]]\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Agropeople}}"}}}]}}}}
