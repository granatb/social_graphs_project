They often dye their hair like regular punks as well, but opt for more pastel shades than electric dyes.\n\nSome pastel punks do not hold the anti-capitalism, anti-corruption and pro-community attitude and views of regular punks, but plenty do. The pastel punks who hold those beliefs and have a love of the same punk music are often regular punks who prefer pastel colors.  \n\nPastel Punk is incredibly similar to [https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Pastel_Goth Pastel Goth], they both take the original style and add more pastel colors to it to match what they feel comfortable in. They may also have slightly different music taste due to their softer nature.\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery widths=\"185\">\n\n598CE279-56C3-4BCF-BF00-C3E1D5736D58.jpeg\nB2BADB7E-4FB1-42BC-BC2B-E697ACF31347.jpg\n\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Punk Suffix]]\n[[Category:Fashion]]\n[[Category:Visual]]\n[[Category:Needs work]]\n[[Category:Feminine]]\n[[Category:Cute]]"}}}]}}}}
