Milk can be split off into various subgenres based off color/flavor. Subgenres can also be applied using other aesthetics like [[grunge]], which can include darker colors and darker imagery. Milk's aesthetic is mostly soft and not far off from [[babycore]] or [[kidcore]]. Milk aesthetic can also apply to milk tea, and others things with similar flavours. \n\n== Visuals ==\n\n* Milk cartons\n* Milk bottles, glass and plastic\n* Drinking glasses and mugs\n* Straws\n* Korean and Japanese words\n* Pastel colors\n* Cartoon art styles\n* Grocery store milk aisles\n\n<br />\n== Fashion ==\nMilk fashion stems from [[softie]], [[babycore]], and [[kawaii]].
