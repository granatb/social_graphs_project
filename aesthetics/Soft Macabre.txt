Unlike something like [[Macaute]], Soft Macabre is purely black and white, and is usually more about photography than it is art. Soft Macabre is grungy in its visuals, with grains and other messy filters being a key part of the Soft Macabre aesthetic. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n== Visuals ==\nSoft Macabre photos have creepiness with soft vibes co-existing. Images are given a black and white filter, and then a grainy filter over it. The point of Soft Macabre is to evoke the feelings of sadness and loneliness in what may just be normal or even happy images. \n== Fashion ==\nSoft Macabre borrows from dark alternative fashion, such as [[emo]] or [[goth]], and adds \"softer\" or \"cuter\" arrangements. Soft Macabre may also influenced by [[grunge]] fashion. It may be similar to aesthetics such as [[Pastel Goth|pastel goth]] or soft grunge. \n\n== Music ==\n* [https://open.spotify.com/playlist/378KbkeCP530hdBgxr0anI?si=Q1O8JFQ3TnKZqf9At2SrCQ macabre vibes Spotify playlist by abs]\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nFile:How-to-soft-macabre.jpg|A guide on how to create Soft Macabre images.\nFile:Soft macabre .jpg\nFile:Soft Macabre Grey.jpg\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Visual]]\n[[Category:Needs work]]\n[[Category:Fashion]]"}}}]}}}}
