The word is a compound of Cyber (referring to the internet and cyberspace) and Ghetto (generally used as a term to describe a group of marginalized individuals).\n\n\n\n== Visual ==\nCyberghetto visuals can borrow heavily from [[Vaporwave]], [[Cyberpunk]], [[Scene]], and [[Hip-Hop]] fashions, often reflecting on the dark and seemingly-isolated feelings the adherent to Cyberghetto usually feels.  These visuals can often touch on some rather dark subject matter like drug addiction, loneliness, heartbreak, and poverty.\n== Fashion ==\nFashion-wise, Cyberghetto can be strongly reminiscent of the [[Y2K]] aesthetic, featuring very bright and bold colors mixed with very shiny elements that can see cuts of black mixed in to make the bold styles really stand out.  However, unlike, the Y2K aesthetic (where its usage is generally unironic and is what people thought the future would look like), their usage in Cyberghetto has a slightly darker twist to them, possibly leaning some into [[Cybergoth]] territory, but without the Gothic undertones.\n\n== Music ==\nMusically, Cyberghetto tends to borrow heavily from Hyperpop and Seapunk\n\n* [https://open.spotify.com/playlist/29PelDlq1r2xoRiOuPve1C?si=JTaoANe0RUmCBNof5e8HTA \u2606 cyberghetto \u2606 Spotify playlist by more.evil]\n* [https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4nBd2vkSbywIQeR4nPG8kW?si=tfyHZltPQyWqtM_y3vK6Mg the cyberghetto Spotify playlist by qakie]\n* [https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1QBajG7U3NDKhSI8VK8EOH?si=jXIVc8-tRB2q8yy1D9fOsg CYBERGHETTO Spotify playlist by Angel]\n* [https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2xDK5PBRFRou9fNO9XsxNF?si=_6IDqX5WR4enaz9XNnwNlg cyberghetto Spotify playlist by Isabella Harris]\n* [https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2vbvlpaG2YosVjAmihrbkl?si=0nyq28FXST2ZsFgWAXd66Q \ud835\udc02\ud835\udc32\ud835\udc1b\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc06\ud835\udc21\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc28\u2766 Spotify playlist by 12143748478]\n* [https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6qx4FVOEyeQgLMQVy1C9hL?si=fd76034922244449 \u0190> wlc : whole lotta cyber Spotify playlist by luvrbabez \u0190>]\n\n== Gallery ==\n''Under Construction''[[Category:Fashion]]\n[[Category:Needs work]]\n[[Category:Written]]"}}}]}}}}
