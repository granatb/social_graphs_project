Though selkies are a big part of the aesthetic, it also covers Celtic and norse marine life in general. The nature aspect features rocky beaches, rocky shorelines, rocky coastlines, the cold ocean itself, cold weather, grey lighting, cloudy skies, and even foggy and misty waters as well.  The setting is usually Ireland, Scotland, as well as Scandinavian and Norse countries like Norway, Sweden, Finland. Harbors, coastal towns and lighthouses as part of this aesthetic as well provided they feature gray cloudy skies, or cold dark waters. \n\n\n\nThe aesthetic is similar to Mermaidcore, but less colorful and flashy, as it favors cooler, darker and neutral colors. While [[Nautical]] centers on the sailormen or fishermen, the sea itself, and sea towns they live on, as well as fish, nets, ships and things like that. This is unlike selkiecore, which centers on mythological sea creatures as well as other marine life, their nature and their habitat. The aesthetic also has a Norse/[[Celtic]] touch because of the myth that selkies are from and the environment of the other marine life.        \n\n== Selkies ==\nSelkies are mythological beings capable of therianthropy, changing from seal to beautiful human form by shedding their skin, sometimes into a coat. They are found in folktales and mythology originating from the Northern Isles of Scotland. The folk-tales frequently revolve around female selkies having their seal skin or coat being stolen and hidden. The thief will then coerce them into relationships or straight up marriage thus exhibiting the tale motif of the swan maiden type.\n\nThe selkie wife trapped on land will spend her time longing for the sea, her true home, and will often be seen gazing longingly at the ocean. She may bear several children by her human husband, but once she discovers her skin, she will immediately return to the sea. Sometimes she will abandon the children she loved, or she will take the children with her. Sometimes, one of her children discovers or knows the whereabouts of the skin. Sometimes it is revealed she already had a first husband of her own kind. Although in some children's story versions, the selkie revisits her family on land once a year, in the typical folktale she is never seen again by them.\n\nMale selkies are described as being very beautiful in their human form, and having great seductive powers over humans. They typically seek those who are dissatisfied with their lives, such as married women waiting for their fishermen/sailormen husbands. Male selkies can be summoned by shedding seven tears into the sea.\n\nThere are counterparts in Faroese and Icelandic folklore that speak of seal-women and seal-skin.\n\n== Marine Life ==\nThough the aesthetic is named after and mostly centers on selkies, the aesthetic also centers on the marine life of the sea of Ireland, Scotland, Norway, Sweden or Finland.\n\n===Scotland===\n* Minke whale\n* Seals\n* Risso's dolphin\n* Basking shark\n* Humpback whale\n* Orca\n\n===Ireland===\n* Atlantic white-sided dolphin\n* Beluga whale\n* Blue whale\n* Bottlenose dolphin \n* False killer whale\n\n===Norway===\n* Beluga whale\n* Harbour seal\n* Killer whale \n* Ringed seal\n* Sperm Whale\n\n===Sweden/Finland===\n* Grey seal\n* Harbour seal\n* Ringed seal\n* Harbour porpoise\n\n== Visuals ==\n* Grey/cloudy skies\n* Seals\n* Seal skin\n* oceans (usually colder climates and where it's less blue and more darker and green)\n* Small coastal towns (usually Irish and Scottish)\n* Lighthouses\n* Harbors (usually Irish and Scottish)\n* Rocky beaches (usually with dark sand)\n*Celtic/norse marine life\n\n== Activities  ==\n* Walks on the beach (especially rocky beaches)\n* Relaxing on the beach (or in general)\n* Swimming in the ocean\n* Singing\n* Romancing\n* Eating fish\n\n== Fashion ==\n=== Women's ===\n* Long plain or simple dresses\n* scarves\n* Shawls\n* Sea like hair accessories\n* sea like jewelry\n* seal coat\n* dark swimwear\n* Scottish/Irish dress clothes \n=== Men's ===\n* button up dress shirts\n* dark trousers\n* seal coat\n* dark swimwear \n* Scottish/Irish dress clothes \n\n== Media ==\n* Song of the Sea (2014)\n* Ondine (2009)\n* The Secret of Roan Inish (1994)\n* The Selkie's Lover (2013)\n* Selkie (2000)\n*Disney Nature Oceans (2009\n*The Whale (2013)\n*The Golden Seal (1983)\n\n== Literature ==\n'''Books about selkies, seals, and marine life.'''\n\n*The Secret of Ron Mor Skerry Rosalie K.
