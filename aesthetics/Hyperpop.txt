The genre puts an extreme emphasis on cuteness, femininity and intoxication. This is achieved by extreme pitching and warping of both the bass and rhythm, as well as upbeat, bubbly synths. The genre stems mainly from club and nightcore, and consists of high levels of surrealism and confusion.\n\n== History ==\nThe genre of hyperpop was born out of EDM and traditional pop, and has influences from electroclash and [[Witch House|witch house]]. Other genres of music that are incorporated into hyperpop include dubstep, chiptune and cloud rap. It is also seen as similar to nu-rave. Another heavy influence on the genre is electroclash, which is a very similar genre which died out in the 2000s.\n\nIn 2019, Spotify listed an official hyperpop playlist, which further publicised the genre. This playlist consisted of 100 Gecs, Slayyyter, Gupi, Caroline Polachek, Hannah Diamond, and Kim Petras.\n\n==Visual==\nFor most Hyperpop art the layout is extremely crowded (an exception would be 100gecs' 1000gecs album). It is a combination of diverse art styles, so I will be sticking with some of the common themes. Most of the images, esepecially cover art from songs produced and sung by individuals who are female have heavy inspiration from other aesthetics such as [[Baddie]], [[Y2K]], and [[Slimepunk]] to a lesser extent.\n\n=== Examples: ===\n<gallery bordersize=\"medium\" bordercolor=\"#d235ca\" widths=\"130\" orientation=\"landscape\">\nHyperpop alice.PNG\nSak.PNG\nRbj.PNG\nPop.PNG\nHeart.PNG\nHpop.PNG\nDonatachi.PNG\nK.PNG\n</gallery>\n\n==Fashion==\nHyperpop fashion is akin to Y2K Baddie (see [[Baddie]]), with wilder element such as vibrant makeup with sparkles, extremely long lashes and glittery, shiny or glossy clothing. Long or well kept hair is seen a key to express yourself and dyed hair is common, as well as long acrylic nails. Bright colors are key!\n\n=== Examples: ===\n__FORCETOC__<gallery widths=\"130\" orientation=\"landscape\">\nN.PNG\nXcx.PNG\nGirlipaper.PNG\nSarah.PNG\nDone.PNG\nHyperpop 2.PNG\n</gallery>\n\n==Music==\n\n*[https://open.spotify.com/artist/6PfSUFtkMVoDkx4MQkzOi3 100gecs]\n*Talking head\n*[https://open.spotify.com/artist/7HfUJxeVTgrvhk0eWHFzV7 underscores]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/artist/25uiPmTg16RbhZWAqwLBy5 Charli XCX]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/artist/053q0ukIDRgzwTr4vNSwab Grimes]\n*GFOTY\n*Kero Kero Bonito\n*Pc music andTune\n*Shawn Wasabi\n*Cosmicosmo\n*Glow Wurm\n*VALENTINE\n*[https://open.spotify.com/artist/17Vw9uuOYB7XYjPt0LNFN0?autoplay=true Machine Girl] \n*[https://open.spotify.com/artist/5HvKzBgj4yphQfBJjBJrhL?autoplay=true Alice Longyu Gao]\n*Hannah Diamond\n*Slayyyter\n*TikTok Daniel\n*[https://open.spotify.com/artist/4cJKDGSv4Dz9QycXYmo565?si=FIvfp42BQ7G1h_6BLr6lXA&dl_branch=1 glaive]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/artist/4hR6Bm9YYtktXzjmKhb1Cn?si=vMYmNviBTSWlzSodfJ-prA&dl_branch=1 ericdoa]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/artist/2GUw9Wzha61PkZoRVv1PDD?si=BYuH7x3MRBWqn2xTRBdq2A&dl_branch=1 aldn]\n*oaf1\n*[https://open.spotify.com/artist/5fAix5NwfNgHQqYRrHIPxo?si=MgCx5Sn8T9WCPkZkOfDGCw&dl_branch=1 SEBii]\n*Danny L Harle\n*LARS\n*Dorian Electra\n*SOPHIE\n*The duo of trust and unity\n*HANA\n*LIZ\n*Serena Smith\n*Boo From MArio\n*ElyOtto\n*Ayesha Erotica\n*That Kid\n*Simple Simon\n*The raving gang\n*Nipa\n*Yammy\n*Turtles and cats\n*the kangaroooo\n*Tusher\n*Toffan\n*Food house\n*Graveyardguy\n*\n\n...and many more! feel free to explore the links!\n\n==Spotify Playlists==\n\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3KT3QqyIDfkWF3cGi9eFOp?si=b84e158115d54786 HYPERPOP BOPS !\u2730 on Spotify by RIC0]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5UqghlPSyGVOjCgg7y1SaG?si=I2-KHZSFQg-pwnBRODjnww \ud83d\udd2abubblegum\ud83d\udd2a Spotify playlist by Ella Lautier]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7DrJ92Lc9UaVB1rKM2UGsg?si=F5PbrIg9T2uzWU_Thmn4UQ The Sound of Hyperpop Spotify playlist by The Sounds of Spotify]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DX7HOk71GPfSw?si=bpXEPYSuQsmyfUEk8qaEPg hyperpop Spotify playlist by Spotify]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5DFsn1pmiTnrqxLzQJ0kOo?si=oU5GajtcRYSc6NlqvsIbsQ HYPERPOP 2020 Spotify playlist by Veronica Steele]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3hTEuGMK6JLxSGDrYlXFsf?si=hIyTjM7bRQG57CpeKueR0Q Hyperpop / Bubblegum Bass / PC Music Spotify playlist by vaughnerich]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7aAsrW4S2kBmPjXLVZfcEC?si=CNTxH6alTqSHqdpB7R-bgQ HYPERPOP Spotify playlist by LIQUORICEBITCH]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5xFRn2axk8DLRFqRqLMFZ5?si=cy33JrsCRnaqkNBiZDbD1A HYPERPOP Spotify playlist by ameer]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4kpHf4ETv5i6uVtn3prpQH?si=DjMbshDURreqVZeUXSyfxA hyperpop Spotify playlist by mot99zii]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/53sMhOA1YRNWsX2Qn2C7Je?si=Dbnf-pTrSkaauva9iB9-eQ HyperPop Orgies Spotify playlist by Justin Hughes]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5HBK6PfPfUsa8Cto7WCz1K?si=QrehwczTQny5hAl5cPCU0Q hyperpop Spotify playlist by daniel.budac]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4upDCOYhLLCatqMsAKon80?si=Mox-dAb6Sy6YiyPewNYc9A hyperpop:the return of pop Spotify playlist by John Delfino]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/62SokrrTqsrgfH4vXGUOyi?si=FHNZObb0SI6mf5-rQ_k0uA FIZZE BOM BAHH Spotify playlist by sleepyyjax]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5QJmCrUgixHsYmUewmr4vc?si=b78db364384c49ad Hyperpop Spotify Playlist by albertlbaker]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3uWdXhH0QbhOJfqfmIxRI7?si=79753cc152094014 Drain Gang Spotify Playlist]\n\n[[Category:Music]]\n[[Category:Visual]]\n[[Category:Fashion]]\n[[Category:Raver]]"}}}]}}}}
