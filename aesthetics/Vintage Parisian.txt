The participants emphasize the importance of self-care, romanticizing small pleasures in life, and cultivating a sophisticated and kind personality. This aesthetic was embodied by the original films, advertisements, and brands, and was later collected into moodboards and blogs by women on tumblr, and later tiktok. While it does resemble other luxury-based aesthetics such as [[Boujee]], its hyper-feminine presentation, vintage lifestyle elements, and lack of necessity to actually purchase luxury items distinguishes itself from others.\n\n<br />\n\n== Visual ==\n\n* Architectural photos\n*Bags and boxes from designer brands\n* Ballet dancing\n* Chandeliers\n*Clips of Old Hollywood movies\n*Lingerie, both on people and in stock photos\n*Makeup, both on a person's face and in the packaging\n*Notes about love\n* People in love\n*Photos of runway details\n*Roses, peonies, and other romantic flowers\n* Streets of Paris\n* Sweets in attractive packaging or with pink toppings\n* Winter photographs.

Followers of Vintage Parisian also seek to emulate movie stars such as Audrey Hepburn and Marilyn Monroe, as well as some modern hyper-feminine characters and celebrities such as Blair Waldorf and Ariana Grande. In line with the lifestyle that emphasizes relaxation and romance, there is a strong emphasis on wearing lingerie and loungewear.

Luxurious pre-war buildings in Paris are the most popular, with a deep appreciation for the elaborate crown molding and white walls. Famous buildings such as The Ritz Paris, the Tiffany & Co. store in New York City, and Laduree stores are very popular due to their connections with celebrities and film, their French aesthetic, and the luxurious atmosphere. Rococo buildings, such as the Palace of Versailles or certain parts of Russia, are also reblogged, typically in snowy winter photographs.                                                                                                                                                                   \n\n\n== Media ==\n\n=== Movies ===\n\n* ''Black Swan'' (2010) (Despite its dark subject matter and depictions of violence, fans of the aesthetic appreciate the ballet scenes and quotes about art)\n* ''Breakfast at Tiffany's'' (1961)\n*''Eloise'' (2003) and ''Eloise at Christmastime'' (2003)\n*''Her Highness and the Bellboy'' (1945)\n* ''High Society'' (1956)\n*''Love in the Afternoon'' (1957)\n*''Marie Antoinette'' (2006)\n* ''Roman Holiday'' (1953)\n* ''Sabrina'' (1954)\n*''Sex and the City: The Movie'' (2008)\n*''Sex and the City 2'' (2010)\n*Midnight in Paris (2011)\n\n=== TV Shows ===\n\n*''Alta Mar'' (2019-2020)\n*''Gossip Girl'' (2007) (GIFs typically edited to be black and white)\n* ''Scream Queens'' (2015) (Appreciated for fashion)\n*''The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel'' (2017-)\n*''The Pursuit of Love'' (2021)\n\n== Music ==\nAs 1930s-1960s is the most popular time period associated with the style, music from these decades, especially in French, is popular. However, contemporary musicians that have a hyper-feminine persona and sing about unrequited love and luxury are also featured in some playlists.\n\n=== Playlists ===\n\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUKC5RAjUdg La Vie Parisienne: French Chansons From the 1930s & 40s Edith Piaf, Reinhardt & Grappelli]\n* [https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3zIaFqFlKxdxOEQgCHDqrQ?si=W3jQlaPZR6iULcbvzjJhow la vie en rose]\n* [https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1kRFbUYgeGGIASBXeZsBIj?si=aVmtMURzSYu1RehjgFBISA Audrey Hepburn Vibes]\n* [https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3R5COOdu900PlmwWZb7vMH?si=MPmNwGaAQsi1X0JJf20_Og velvet fever]\n\n== Notes ==\nUnfortunately, while this aesthetic is accessible and generally recognized, there is no official name or community with an established manifesto/set of guidelines.
