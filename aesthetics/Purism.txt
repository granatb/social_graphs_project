Led by Am\u00e9d\u00e9e Ozenfant\u00a0and\u00a0Charles Edouard Jeanneret (Le Corbusier), Purism was born from criticism of the decorative [[Cubism|Cubist]] movement. In purism, objects are represented as pure forms, devoid of detail. \n\n== ''Apr\u00e8s le Cubisme'' ==\nThe essay ''Apr\u00e8s le Cubisme'' (After Cubism) was written by Ozenfant and Le Corbusier and published in 1918. This essay demonstrated the main concepts behind Purism. Some of them are as follows:<ref>https://arthive.com/encyclopedia/4347~Purism</ref>\n* Painting is as good as the internal qualities of its plastic elements are, but not their representative or narrative capabilities\n* Purism strives to think clearly, create faithfully, precisely, squarely\n* Serious art must expel all the techniques which are not true to the real value of the concept\n* Art is primarily in the concept\n* Technique is just a tool that humbly serves the concept\n* Purism does not consider that a return to nature means copying nature\n* It admits that any deformation is justified by the search for an invariant.\n\n== Artists ==\n* Serge Charchoune\n* Charles Edouard Jeanneret (Le Corbusier)\n* Fernand L\u00e9ger\n* Am\u00e9d\u00e9e Ozenfant\u00a0\n*Nikos Engonopoulos\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nOzen-glasses-bottles.jpg|Glasses and Bottles (Am\u00e9d\u00e9e Ozenfant)\u00a0\nPurism-6.jpeg|Composition II (Am\u00e9d\u00e9e Ozenfant, 1929)\nPurism-8.jpeg|Nacres (Am\u00e9d\u00e9e Ozenfant, 1926)\nPurism-9.jpeg|Composition puriste (Am\u00e9d\u00e9e Ozenfant, 1926)\nPurism-10.jpeg|Le pichet blanc\nLeger-mechanical elements.jpg|Mechanical Elements (Fernand L\u00e9ger)\nPurism.jpg|Nature Morte (Le Corbusier)\nPurism-11.jpeg|Still Life Filled with Space (Le Corbusier, 1924)\nPurism-5.jpeg|Composition, cubism ornemental (Serge Charchoune, 1922)\n</gallery>\n\n== References ==\n* https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/purism#!#resultType:masonry\n** https://www.wikiart.org/en/amedee-ozenfant/all-works#!#filterName:Style_purism,resultType:masonry\n** https://www.wikiart.org/en/le-corbusier/all-works#!#filterName:Style_purism,resultType:masonry\n* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purism\n\n[[Category:Visual]]\n[[Category:Art]]\n[[Category:Movement]]\n[[Category:Needs work]]\n[[Category:Art movements]]\n<references />\n[[Category:Ism suffix]]"}}}]}}}}
