Often glorifying Japanese animation styles prevalent in the 1990s through early 2000s as well as \"VOCALOID,\" a musical computer software that uses anime visuals. Animecore tends to overlap with other aesthetic genres, like [[Cartooncore]], [[Vaporwave]], [[Old Web|Webcore]], [[Cyberpunk]] or [[Scene]], due to Animecore's rise in reaction to \"cringe culture\" that is increasingly prevalent on the internet.\n\nAnimecore is not anime itself, but rather the images consumed outside the context of the stories anime is conveying. The aesthetic culture here is the Western fans of the Japanese genre, rather than the artistic environment within anime, which can encompass multiple aesthetics. \n\nFrequent motifs are \"Magical Girl Anime\", such as Sailor Moon, Cardcaptor Sakura, Tokyo Mew Mew and other anime, like Lucky Star, VOCALOID song PVs, anime-related YouTube videos from 2007-2012, pastel manga edits, Touhou, gaudy Blingee-esque edits and frequently stolen and edited art from the early 2000s that was often parallel to Scene and Emo culture. Ball-jointed dolls and anime figures are also popular. Sometimes, distortion methods are used to lower image quality to replicate the look of many old web artifacts.\n\n== Visuals ==\nThe primary visual of Animecore is Moe characters, who evoke feelings of affection within viewers. They are always young girls with large eyes, colorful and distinctive hairstyles, and [[kawaii]] outfits such as school and maid uniforms. \n\nImages of bedrooms cluttered with anime merchandise, such as posters, figurines, and banners show the simultaneously obsessive and cozy feelings that Animecore conveys.  \n\n==Fashion==\nAnimecore fashion is normally centered around either a particular anime or around the anime aesthetic in general. \n\nHere are some examples of Anime fashion, non-cosplay:\n\n*Anime graphic tops and bottoms\n*Sailor uniforms\n*Maid dresses\n*Pleated skirts\n*Layered tulle skirts\n*Loose leg warmers\n*Printed thigh highs\n*Stripe socks\n*Platform shoes\n*Plush animal ears\n*Colorful hairpins\n*Scrunchies with kawaii motifs\n*Kandi featuring anime themes\n*Itabags\n*Circle lens\n*Big eye makeup\n*Anime-style blush\n*Otherwise wearable anime merch (necklaces, badges, keychains, etc)\n\n==Subgenres ==\n[[File:Itabags.jpeg|thumb|Itabags]]\n\n===Itasha===\n'''Itasha''' is a subculture of [[Carcore|car culture]], where people will decorate their cars that are themed after different anime, manga and video game characters. Itasha can also extend to motorcycles (which is referred to as ''itansha''), bicycles (which is referred to as ''itachari''), aircraft, computer cases, bags (which is referred to as ''itabag'') and consumable automotive products. The Itasha aesthetic has even extended to the world of motorsports (''see below in the gallery'').\n\n===Yandere===\n[[Yandere]] is an [[Animecore|Anime]] offshoot of [[Lovecore]], based on the anime character trope \"Yandere.\" Yandere characters in anime are characterized as violent and unhealthily obsessive towards love interests. They are frequently described as lovesick or mentally ill. \n\n==Resources==\nExternal links to help get a better understanding of this aesthetic.\n\n===Vendors===\n\n*[https://www.omocat-shop.com/ Omocat]\n*[https://www.incontrolclothing.com/ In Control Clothing]\n*[https://www.hvyblk.com/ HVY BLK]\n*[https://invasion.club/ Invasion Club]\n*[https://catoriclothing.com Catori Clothing]\n*[https://imouri.com/ Imouri]\n*[https://animelife.us/ Animelife]\n*[https://bakuretsu.co/ Bakuretsu]\n*[https://www.steady-hands.com/ Steady Hands]\n\n===Playlists===\n\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/18kMJTMwUuYlxH74EYHqTa?si=CEqfJB_fS_uMHjCEwAu4Fg Animecore Spotify playlist by Frenchgab]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6kEnuMXsQnpGYK4Hs3ORnB?si=TQhBtB8rSm22V3bKOTVOtQ animecore \ud83e\udd7a\u2728 Spotify playlist by M]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7G4JX3f7uS89p6DWZOzXzA?si=MgwNb_kjTlWWWKmxRLFbiA mix; animecore Spotify playlist dickgry]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0zYfPAjECHsmpTdtKEUyp8?si=4y3KIF4GRZ6luC9GipjNgw Anime Openings and Endings (Japanese) Spotify playlist by hata251]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/67kGhiACUDj40UPDgFJvAA?si=mV4LTgZCQeets0AXd8gs7Q Animecore Spotify Playlist by Nate Bunny Lyman]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1zVtZBwnOfq3BW1V5AXuoa \ud83d\udcabAnime TikTok \ud83d\udcab Spotify playlist by Junko]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/27Fmk3gZblpEyBGtvtm5Hp ~K-on playlist~ Spotify playlist by ~\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc63~\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc66~]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7fd9fl24tvkzSBx8AoMaYS <nowiki>{[Death Devil Playlist]} Spotify playlist by ~\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc63~\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc66~</nowiki>]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2jrEENQtYcz4SxXECnrjZ6?si=c846b86d517d4ddb anime vibes for my weeb-bros]\n*https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2IinPQsFJpUkjH0ZiTmwIP?si=JzHmDpTgRlGqpTyyzrUr_Q&utm_source=copy-link&dl_branch=1\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" widths=\"135\" spacing=\"small\" position=\"center\">\nTumblr ph7ot9qWi71w4pa98 1280.jpg|Misako from Koko wa Green Wood\n7f63968c8f14a5b3d2285071e0042241.jpg|K-On!\nTumblr pmqxbkAO0u1txvytpo1 500.jpg|Animecore Panty\nTumblr pmqxbkAO0u1txvytpo2 400.jpg|Animecore Stocking\n118767153 3219240698171037 92127588676049208 o.jpg|Animecore Fashion\n1280px-No.111 EVA RT TYPE-01 Rn-s AMG GT at 2016 International Suzuka 1000km (2).jpg|An Itasha'd out Mercedes Benz racing cart patterned after EVA Unit 01 from Neon Genesis Evangelion\nTumblr 64e0713b0ebd2ebf49c7a1eeb203f123 bdfeac1c 500.gif\nTumblr pk0q89Vpvv1uf8sac 400.jpg\nTumblr pwvf8ik6xw1yt0azko3 500.gif|Animecore Miku\n6F869DEC-52D4-4F63-811D-C0377D096EE0.jpeg|another Animecore Miku\nFile:Luckystar.jpg\nCute.gif\nLucky Star.jpg|Lucky Star\nBd01389fbd729c9721f8d9c215bdc3b0.jpg\nC4920727e3972c4c23b51e035826542d.jpg|more miku\nHb7eb8eb5ac26435c85b78facf40361b8N.jpg q50.jpg\n30026a67279c853a5bd922565f9f7c21.jpg\nAbc123camera.jpg\nSIPS.jpg|Stocking from Panty and Stocking\nZaqoxc3sww.jpg\nMadoka Magika.jpg|madoka magica\nRei.jpg|Rei from Sailor Moon\nSailor Moon.jpg|Sailor Moon\n57D4DB69-D0A1-490A-AB08-CC471181A4B9.jpeg|\ud83d\udc96creamy mami\ud83d\udc99 (1983 - 1984)\n89A499F0-6F15-42D8-A514-6EE4425A5046.jpeg|\ud83d\udc99Minky momo \ud83d\udc96 (1982 - 1983)\nSailor Moon Arcade.jpg\nNyancatanimation.gif|Youmu Nyan cat Touhou animation\nTh.jpeg|nene yashiro\nTumblr aef96b8a0de5b66a3d9bc8d74ff86ca5 c2a2d34e 2048.jpg|chizuru miuhara from rent a girlfriend\nTumblr d4d8a6c38f1e45e7f8de04f8db572050 624b865e 250.jpg|milim nava\nManun chan edit.png|Manun-chan! \u2661\n181AB1B7-455B-4B28-99BA-D17684C77B82.jpeg\nFile:(\u00b0\u25bd\u00b0).jpg\nCE4CC9B1-5675-47A3-AD06-9F5F53FC08B8.jpeg\n3E0963E5-41DA-45BC-9F40-63FCD6F04714.jpeg\n3BB270D1-40EC-468B-A711-F84EC5C168A5.gif\nFile:Dm for creds.jpg\n5AAE6553-D564-4474-B37D-9C8A84E16DD3.jpeg\nFF089B0C-8276-440A-9A44-B50C08FD5F87.gif\nD669FB98-CDCD-4961-A374-97BA49FEFD0D.jpeg\nTomokopfp.png|tomoko kuroki lolz (i love her sm)\nOnepiece foto crop1602515525324.jpg 497688823.jpg|One Piece\nHim\u014dto-Umaru-chan.jpeg|Himouto!
