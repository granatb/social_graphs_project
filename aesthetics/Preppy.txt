Crew, Lilly Pulitzer Lacoste, Ralph Lauren}}'''Preppy'''\u00a0(also spelled\u00a0'''Preppie''') or\u00a0'''Prep'''\u00a0(all abbreviations of the word\u00a0preparatory) is a\u00a0subculture\u00a0in the\u00a0United States that is associated with old\u00a0private\u00a0Northeastern\u00a0university-preparatory schools. The terms are used to denote a person seen as characteristic of a student or\u00a0alumnus\u00a0of these schools. Characteristics of preps in the past, include a particular\u00a0subcultural\u00a0speech, vocabulary, dress, mannerisms and\u00a0etiquette, reflective of an\u00a0upper-class\u00a0upbringing.  \n\nIt is one of the four high school stereotypes used in a popular alignment chart, along with Jock, [[Nerd]], and [[Goth]].\n\n== History ==\n''This section is under construction''\n\nIn 1980, Lisa Birnbach published ''The Official Preppy Handbook'', which described many aspects of upper-middle-class WASP life in a tongue-in-cheek tone. It outlines the life of a Preppy, including the fashion, colleges, activities, etc. of such a person to an audience that typically would not have been exposed to such an exclusive class of people.<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Official_Preppy_Handbook</ref> \n\nAlthough the book was meant to be humorous, many Preps today take it extremely seriously, while acknowledging some of the information is dated.\n\n== Visual ==\nThe Preppy visual aesthetic draws a lot of cues from the upper classes of society that would often eventually find themselves attending some sort of Ivy League school like Harvard, Princeton or Yale.\n\nThere are two generally accepted variants of the Preppy aesthetic. One is '''New England Prep''' or '''East Coast Prep''', which has a lot of [[nautical]] elements like anchors, compasses, ships, lighthouses, and whales. Hydrangeas are also associated with New England Prep as they are common on Nantucket. The colors used are found in nature - olive green, navy blue, beige, tan, and dark red.\n\nThe other is '''Southern Prep''', which includes elements like palm trees, elephants, monkeys, and zebras. Lilly Pulitzer is a good example of these types of patterns. The colors are much brighter and more saturated: hot pink, kelly green, lime green, bright yellow, turquoise, and orange. Contrasting colors are often paired together: pink with green or blue, orange with green or blue, red with blue or green, and yellow with blue or turquoise. Purple and shades of purple like lavender are not commonly used. Southern Prep is more casual than New England Prep and bare arms and legs are more common. \n\nMembers of sororities and fraternities often come from middle class and upper class families who follow the Preppy aesthetic. While members of sororities and fraternities are expected to be on their best behavior at all times, the darker side of Greek Life (hazing, drugs, alcoholism and hard partying, rape, and racism) makes people wary of Preps.\n\nDuring the spring and summer, the \"Chads\" and \"Beckys\" who visit Nantucket are subjects of mockery for their basic drink orders, boring sense of fashion, and inexperience driving on sand. Chads and Beckys are also associated with the phrase \"My father is a lawyer.\"<ref>[https://www.instagram.com/Chadtucket Chadtucket Instagram]</ref>\n\n<br />\n\n== Related Aesthetics within Prep ==\n\n=== Related To East Coast or New England Prep ===\n\n===== Ivy <ref>[https://www.reddit.com/r/NavyBlazer/wiki/preps Different Types of Preps (Navy Blazer Reddit)]</ref>=====\nNamed after the Ivy League colleges, this is influenced be the clothing worn by college students beginning in the 1940s to about the 1960s. \n\n===== Trad =====\nThe \u201cgrown up\u201d extension of Ivy, it is more noticeably Vintage than Preppy. Bright colors are usually only used for a single accent piece, such as socks. Suits are tweed, Prince of Wales check (usually gray), or navy pinstripe. Blazers can be double breasted or single breasted. Elbow patches on tweed jackets are common. Recognizable due to the pairing of loafers with a two or three piece suit.\n\n===== Neo Prep or Nouveau Prep, or Sprezzatura (Italy) =====\nAdds sneakers, jeans (sometimes cuffed at the ankles), and baseball caps to outfits that include blazers. Argyle is a common pattern for socks. Facial hair such as beards and mustaches are worn by men.\n\nThe Tommy Hilfiger designs from the 2000s, and most of the outfits worn by Kiel James and Sarah Patrick are really Neo Prep.\n\n=== Related To Southern Prep ===\n\n===== Southern Belle =====\nHeavily influenced by the book and movie ''Gone with the Wind'', the [[Southern Belle]] aesthetic values tradition, family, politeness, and femininity. It is controversial due to the historical association with slavery, and modern associations with racism and the Confederacy. Plantation Weddings are common for Southern couples.<br />\n\n== Politics ==\nAlthough the Preppy aesthetic is not inherently political, the aesthetic was formed by people who had similar socioeconomic background, heritage and political leanings. Traditionally, Preps were associated with WASP culture (white Anglo-Saxon Protestant), but there is no requirement of race or religion to follow the aesthetic. The most famous Preppy family, the Kennedys, are Catholic.\n\nThe WASP background has led many Preps to have an idealized idea of American history, glossing over and even ignoring significant events and the way in which they affected the lives of Native Americans, Black Americans, LGBTQIA+ people, and disabled people.\n\nAn example of this is how the Republican Party is often referred to by Republicans as \"The Party of Lincoln.\" While it is true that President Abraham Lincoln was a Republican, the Republican Party of the time had an ideology which was more closely aligned with the Democratic Party of today.\n\nThe Preps of the 1980s were overwhelmingly supporters of President Ronald Reagan. To this day, Preps who were not even born when Reagan was president associate him with the Prep aesthetic, ignoring his denial of the AIDs Crisis in the 1980s, a choice which killed thousands of members of the LGBTQIA+ community. Other preps are far more liberal, active in the Black Lives Matter movement, and fight for women's and LGBTQ+ rights. In younger Preps, this liberalism is a backlash against the actions of Donald Trump and the modern Republican party.\n\nMany members of mainstream society are uncomfortable with Southern Preps because they believe these people uphold outdated and dangerous ideals, due to the American South's association with slavery, antisemitism, racism, and homophobia. The practice of Plantation Weddings and the culture of the Southern Belle, influenced by movies like ''Gone with the Wind'' all play into this. The actual degree to which a person who follows the prep aesthetic upholds these ideals (if at all) varies from person to person.\n\nThe brand Brooks Brothers became tainted in June 2020 when Mark McCloskey was photographed wearing a Brooks Brothers polo while threatening Black Lives Matter demonstrators alongside his wife Patricia.\n\n==Fashion ==\nFor men, Preppy fashion has its roots in the\u00a0Ivy League style of dress, which started around 1912 and\u00a0became more established in the late 1950s. J. Press\u00a0represented the quintessential Ivy League style, stemming from the collegiate traditions of\u00a0Ivy League schools. In the mid-twentieth century\u00a0J. Press\u00a0and\u00a0Brooks Brothers\u00a0both had stores on\u00a0Ivy League\u00a0school campuses, including\u00a0Harvard,\u00a0Princeton, and\u00a0Yale. Preppy fashion emerged in the late 1970s with cues from the original Ivy League style. Some typical Preppy styles also reflect traditional upper-class leisure activities, once associated with the wealthy English who once had a strong political and social position in the Northeast and New England, such as\u00a0polo,\u00a0sailing,\u00a0hunting,\u00a0fencing,\u00a0crew rowing,\u00a0lacrosse,\u00a0golf,\u00a0tennis,\u00a0rugby,\u00a0squash and\u00a0swimming. This association with old English inspired outdoor activities can be seen in Preppy fashion, through stripes and colors, equestrian clothing, field jackets, and nautical-themed accessories. By the 1980s, mass marketing of brands such as\u00a0Lacoste,\u00a0Daniel Cremieux,\u00a0Izod, and\u00a0Dooney & Bourke became associated with\u00a0Preppy style\u00a0in many areas of the US and Canada.\n\nFor women, Preppy-influenced fashions emerged in the 1960s, a trend led by designers such as\u00a0Perry Ellis\u00a0and\u00a0Lilly Pulitzer, influenced by designers such as\u00a0Oleg Cassini, and popularized by female students at the\u00a0Seven Sisters Colleges, sister institutions to the\u00a0Ivy League. These classic ensembles of the 1960s and 1970s include tailored skirt suits, low heels, wrap dresses, shift dresses, silk or cotton blouses, and jewelry with a refined style. Such clothing often includes elements drawn from typical Preppy style, such as nautical stripes, pastel colours, or equestrian details.\n\nThough traditional interest in Preppy style fell in the 1990s,\u00a0some of the newer outfitters such as\u00a0Ralph Lauren,\u00a0J. Crew,\u00a0Vineyard Vines,\u00a0Gant, and Elizabeth McKay are perceived as having preppy styles, with designers such as\u00a0Marc Jacobs\u00a0and\u00a0Luella Bartley\u00a0adding the Preppy style into their clothes in the 1990s. The Preppy aesthetic fell out of popularity when the Financial Crisis of 2007\u20132008 made signifiers of wealth unpopular.\n\nThose who follow the Preppy aesthetic pride themselves on how timeless it is. In reality, the Preppy aesthetic goes in and out of fashion. Previously strict followers of the Prep aesthetic such as cousins Audrey Kelleher, Charles McBryde, and Jenna Sweeney, have moved towards a more [[Bohemian]] aesthetic.\n\n=== Stores and Brands ===\n* Barbour\n* Burberry\n* Brooks Brothers\n* CatherineCameo\n* Cartier\n* David Yurman\n* Draper James\n* Hermes\n* Hillflint\n* Hunter\n* J.

Sports have often been used to make a college applicant look more impressive, and sports that are more obscure and traditionally associated with these classes are played because the money involved keeps out other students who would have been able to use their skills to succeed, as in basketball or soccer. Many of these non-sporting activities are associated with older \"company men\" who got to where they are via generational wealth and economic and social capital. Many of these were described in a now retracted [https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/11/squash-lacrosse-niche-sports-ivy-league-admissions/616474/ Atlantic article] which exposed many readers to the dramatic world of obscure sports (with more drama than the truth.)
