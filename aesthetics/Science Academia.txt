It differs from most other academic aesthetics, including the most popular in the category, which center on the arts and humanities. \n\nScience academia visuals vary among disciplines, but they share some common traits. Like many other academic aesthetics, science academia visuals are predominantly inspired by photographs from and paraphernalia prevalent in academic settings during the late 19th and early 20th century.\n\nThe most popular branches of science presented in visuals and communities are mathematics, physics, chemistry, astronomy, microbiology, and human anatomy and physiology. \n\nScience academia is often described as [[Dark Academia|dark academia]] applied to the sciences.<br />\n\n== Philosophy ==\nCentral to science academia philosophy are the values of the scientific method and the pursuit of knowledge. \n\n* Discovery is your motive.\n*Learning for the sake of learning.\n*Stay curious and keep asking questions.\n*Knowledge is found through experimentation.\n*Nothing is impossible to discover\n*Knowledge is worth the risk<br />\n\n<br />\n\n== Activities ==\n\n* Staying up till 4 AM just to look out into the sky.\n*Staying up till 4 AM to finish your thesis.\n*Trolling greedy universities and publishers by copying the DOIs/URLs of journal artilces into [https://sci-hub.st/ Sci-Hub] \n* Ranting about this new advancements in your field to anybody who would listen.\n* Ranting about the importance of your field to anybody who listens.\n*Arguing about which discipline is the best/most important\n* Spending hours searching universities' libraries for science books to read in your spare time.\n*Reading scientific articles not related to your specialty, for the taste of science.\n* Science Fiction in any form.\n*Playing chess\n* Attending public lectures.\n*Seeing if grad students and professors real academics or just NPCs.\n*Writing a scientific article about your last research.\n* Re-watching video lectures for the 100th time.\n* Passionately debating theories and ideas.\n*Being excited over the smallest interesting fact or smallest discovery\n*Correcting people for small factual mistakes\n*Theorizing\n*Going down research rabbit holes\n*Contributed knowledge to public edit-able documents (ex.

The main idea is anything comfortable for studying and doing experiments but with a more classical or uniform-like look for researchers and teachers.   \n\nWarm-tone, earthy, and dark colors, especially any brown or black shades, work for this aesthetic. Brighter pops of color like bright (or not so bright) reds, greens, yellows, blues and purples work as well.  \n\n===Tops===\n\n*Print T-shirts, Texts, Any fandom print or Solid color.\n*Polo shirts\n*Button downs\n*Work-type blouses\n* Lab coats\n*Coats in general (trench coats, overcoats, etc)\n*Blazers\n*Sweaters, turtle-neck sweaters, and anything for cold and rainy weather\n*Anything with pockets\n\n===Bottoms===\n\n* Any comfortable pants, (Jeans, Trousers, looser pants)\n*Suit pants\n*Skirts (mid/long length, plaid, pencil, or anything with great mobility)\n*Cigarette pants\n*Pinafores\n\n===Footwear===\n\n*Boots (ankle boots, Dr. Martens, Combat boots\n*Oxfords\n*Mary Janes\n*Knee high socks\n*Solid colour tights\n*Sneakers\n*Kitten heels\n\n=== Accessories===\n\n*Satchel/tote bag to hold your books, chess board, journal, computer, etc.\n*Watches\n*Hair ties\n*Thick belts\n*Glasses/Goggles\n*Simple jewelry\n*Enamel pins to decorate your stuff\n*Anything simple and small.\n\n<br />\n\n===Vendors===\n\n====Work clothing====\n\n*Alexandra Workwear\n*Medisave\n*Better Equipped\n* Nothing but safety glasses\n\n====Themed clothing====\n\n* TeePublic\n*RedBubble\n*Shenova Fashion\n*ScienceWear\n\n<br />[[File:Library.png|thumb|Cambridge Public Library|alt=]]\n\n==Visuals ==\n\n*Universities and colleges\n*Old libraries and bookstores\n*Studying in rainy/cold weather (and feeling mysterious)\n*Indoor spaces\n*Any time between 10 pm and 6 am\n*Museums\n*Messy Desks\n*Studying a very specific question from the lecture during breaks\n*Old stores\n*Telescope observatories\n*Notebooks filled up to the edge with equations and writings\n*Science fiction\n* Video Lectures\n*Historic sites and locations\n*Historic towns and cities\n*Old towns\n*A dark linoleum-tiled hallway\n*Glass vial topped with a rubber stopper\n* Mad scientists and inventive chemists\n*Periodic table\n*A computer with many tabs open\n*Astronomy maps\n*Globes and maps \n*A room plastered with posters\n*Long summer road trips to see something obscure\n*Windows open to get your only fresh air for the day\n*Stretching while not getting off your seat<br />\n\n==Media==\n\n===Websites===\n\n* Reddit\n*Quora\n* ResearchGate\n*Sci-Hub\n* YouTube\n*Chess.com\n\n===Figures and entertainment===\n''Natural sciences''\n\n* Hank Green\n*Whisper of the heart\n*X-Files\n* Contact (Carl Sagan)\n*Contact (1997)\n*A Beautiful Mind (2001)\n*Creation (2009)\n*Any Star Wars film\n*A Dangerous Method (2011)\n* The Theory of Everything (2014)\n*Interstellar (2014)\n*Experimenter (2015)\n*Hidden Figures (2016)\n*Westworld (2016- )\n*Any video lectures in your field\n*[https://efegiller.itch.io/chaotic-academia-a-noir-robotics-mystery Chaotic Academia: A Noir Robotics Mystery]\n*Dr. Stone\n*Any Star trek film\n*Space Force\n*Mythbusters\n*ASAP Science (YouTube)\n* Numberphile (YouTube)\n*Sam O'Nella Academy (YouTube)\n\n''Social Sciences''\n\n*Dystopia - 1984, cyberpunk, Snow Piercer, Hunger Games, Mad Max, etc.\n*Death of a Salesman by Arthur Miller\n*Adam Ruins Everything (TV Show)\n*The Handmaid's Tale (TV Show)\n*Richard D.
