Heavy Metal was the culmination of the Acid rock heard in the late 1960s - a genre that describes the heavier sounding Psychedelic rock first played by various bands of the San Francisco music scene. The genre evolved further throughout the 1970s and into the 1980s, when it first reached mainstream popularity - and simultaneously diversified into myriad sub-genres in the underground scene. Metal music is easy to notice; loud guitars, fast drumming and violent lyrics generally being the main components. Bands credited for the start of metal range from the heavy blues of  Led Zeppelin and Jimi Hendrix, to the occult rock stylings of Coven and Blue \u00d6yster Cult, and on to the likes of Alice Cooper, Pentagram and Black Sabbath. Because of the sound, it became cause for panic by Christian parents, who believed the music to be Satanic and a bad influence for children during the 80s. Despite the pushback, metal is still popular in many facets of music, influencing genres such as [[grunge]], [[Nu-Metal|nu-metal]] and rap metal among many, many other subgenres and microgenres. Fans of metal are called '''headbangers''' or '''metalheads'''.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n== Music ==\nWhile some metalheads may introduce some variety into their musical tastes, the vast majority of their musical diet is heavy metal. This is also music that a lot of people involved in [[Brocore|bodybuilding]] will listen to while working out to keep them motivated and pushing their bodies beyond their known limits to sculpt their bodies in the desired way (be they Mass Monster or Classic bodybuilders), which can lead to a lot of crossover between the Bodybuilder and the Metalhead (and sometimes a combination of the two, which can cut an imposing silhouette).\n\n'''Heavy metal'''\u00a0(or simply\u00a0metal) is a genre of\u00a0rock music that \ndeveloped in the late 1960s and early 1970s, largely in the\u00a0United \nKingdom and the United States.\u00a0With roots in\u00a0blues rock,\u00a0psychedelic rock, and\u00a0acid rock, the \nbands that created heavy metal developed a thick, massive sound, \ncharacterized by highly amplified\u00a0distortion, extended\u00a0guitar solos, \nemphatic beats, and overall loudness. The genre's lyrics and performance\n<nowiki> </nowiki>styles are sometimes associated with\u00a0aggression\u00a0and\u00a0machismo.\n\n===<u>Spotify playlists</u>===\n\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DX9qNs32fujYe?si=IOaq204GRXm9unWMo0_HYQ Heavy Metal Official Spotify playlist]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/27gN69ebwiJRtXEboL12Ih?si=W93vKmqeRwSCJNa9me2gJA HEAVY METAL CLASSICS Spotify playlist by celsum76]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/59mEhWTdhyqNjk6JnvwGGS?si=k7VpVr40TLySHaX85s2Q5g Heavy Metal Workout Music Spotify playlist by ksf18z]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7bcOsrWwa5jASp5zwr6RXD?si=nkuVoQbqRk-9KbvLAX5hbQ 80s Heavy Metal Spotify playlist by Kjetil Myhre]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1oWD4uRPIsVvFFMPYeUDZR?si=alcox5cLQyiwAzMBu1jqFw Heavy Metal | Workout Motivation Spotify playlist by Bodybuilding.com]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3yRgvjS4T3flibjB3kFD10?si=IneTLfXuQtS2BSWdmS7R3Q Ambient/Atmospheric Metal Spotify playlist by brookeroling]\n\n== Subgenres ==\n\n===<u>Black Metal</u>===\nBlack Meta'''l'''\u00a0is an\u00a0extreme\u00a0subgenre of\u00a0heavy metal music. Common traits include\u00a0fast tempos, a\u00a0shrieking\u00a0vocal style, heavily distorted\u00a0guitars\u00a0played with\u00a0tremolo picking, raw (lo-fi) recording, unconventional\u00a0song structures, and an emphasis on atmosphere. Artists often appear in\u00a0corpse paint\u00a0and adopt pseudonyms.\n===<u>Death Metal</u>===\nDeath Metal\u00a0is an\u00a0extreme\u00a0subgenre of\u00a0heavy metal.\n<nowiki> </nowiki>It typically employs heavily distorted and low-tuned guitars, played \nwith techniques such as\u00a0palm muting\u00a0and\u00a0tremolo picking, \ndeep\u00a0growling\u00a0vocals, aggressive, powerful drumming featuring\u00a0double \nkick\u00a0and\u00a0blast beat\u00a0techniques, minor keys or\u00a0atonality, abrupt tempo, \nkey, and time signature changes, and\u00a0chromatic\u00a0chord progressions. The \nlyrical themes of death metal may include\u00a0slasher film-style violence, \npolitical conflict,\u00a0religion,\u00a0nature,\u00a0philosophy, and\u00a0science fiction.\n\n===<u>Deathgrind</u>===\nDeathgrind (sometimes written as death-grind or death/grind) is a shorthand term that is used to describe bands who play a fusion of death metal and [[Metal| grindcore]].\n\n===<u>Drone Metal</u>===\nDrone Metal (or drone doom), is a style of heavy metal that melds the slow tempos and heaviness of doom metal with the long-duration tones of drone music.\n\n===<u>Funk Metal</u>===\nFunk Metal is a fusion genre of\u00a0funk\u00a0rock and \nalternative\u00a0metal\u00a0which infuses heavy\u00a0metal\u00a0music (often thrash\u00a0metal) \nwith elements of\u00a0funk\u00a0and punk rock. It was popular in the mainstream \nduring the late 1980s and early 1990s, as part of the \nalternative\u00a0metal\u00a0movement.\n\n=== <u>Glam Metal</u> ===\n''TBA''\n\n===<u>Grindcore</u>===\nGrindcore is an extreme fusion genre of heavy metal and hardcore punk that originated in the mid-1980s, drawing inspiration from abrasive-sounding musical styles, such as: thrashcore, crust punk, hardcore punk, extreme metal, and industrial.\n\n===<u>Groove Metal</u>===\nGroove Metal (also known as post-thrash or neo-thrash) is a subgenre of heavy metal music. Music journalists and fans have used groove metal to describe Pantera, Exhorder and Machine Head. At its core, groove metal takes the intensity and sonic qualities of thrash metal and plays them at mid-tempo, with most bands making only occasional forays into fast tempo.\n\n===<u>Goregrind</u>===\nGoregrind is a fusion genre of grindcore and death metal. British band Carcass are commonly credited for the emergence of the genre. It is recognized for its heavily edited, pitch shifted \"watery\"-sounding vocals and abrasive musicianship rooted in grindcore.\n\n=== <u>Gothic Metal</u> ===\n''TBA.''\n\n===<u>Melodic Black Metal</u>===\nMelodic Black Metal\u00a0(also known as\u00a0blackened melodic death metal\u00a0or\u00a0melodic blackened death metal) is a genre of\u00a0extreme metal\u00a0that describes the style created when melodic death metal bands began being inspired by\u00a0black metal\u00a0and European\u00a0romanticism. However, unlike most other black metal, this take on the genre would incorporate an increased sense of melody and narrative.\n\n===<u>Melodic Death Metal</u>===\nMelodic Death Metal\u00a0(also referred to as\u00a0melodeath) is a subgenre\n<nowiki> </nowiki>of\u00a0death metal\u00a0that employs highly melodic guitar riffs, often \nborrowing from traditional\u00a0heavy metal.\n\n=== <u>Power Metal</u> ===\nPower Metal is a subgenre of metal that focuses on grandiose instrumentals and clean, powerful vocals. Lyrical content can vary, but many bands tend to focus on either war or medieval fantasy.\n\n===<u>Progressive Metal</u>===\nProgressive Metal\u00a0(or\u00a0prog metal) is a fusion genre melding \nheavy\u00a0metal\u00a0and\u00a0progressive\u00a0rock that combines the loud \"aggression\" and\n<nowiki> </nowiki>amplified guitar-driven sound of the former with the more experimental,\n<nowiki> </nowiki>cerebral or \"pseudo-classical\" compositions of the latter.\n\nA subgenre of Progressive Metal, '''Djent''', is made distinct by a high-gain, distorted, palm-muted, low-pitch guitar sound. The name \"Djent\" is an onomatopoeia of this sound.\n\n=== <u>Symphonic Metal</u> ===\n''TBA''\n\n===<u>Unblack Metal</u>===\nUnblack Metal is a religious philosophy within black metal whose \nartists are either directly against the Satanism prevalent in black \nmetal, or promote Christianity in their lyrics and imagery.\n\n===<u>War Metal</u>===\nWar Metal\u00a0(also known as\u00a0war black metal or\u00a0bestial black \nmetal) is an aggressive, cacophonous and chaotic\u00a0subgenre of blackened \ndeath metal, described by\u00a0''Rock Hard''\u00a0journalist Wolf-R\u00fcdiger \nM\u00fchlmann as \"rabid\" and \"hammering\".\u00a0Important influences include first \nwave black metal band\u00a0Sodom,first wave black metal/death metal band\u00a0''Possessed'' as well as old\u00a0grindcore, black and death metal bands like\u00a0''Repulsion'',\u00a0''Autopsy'',\u00a0''Sarc\u00f3fago''\u00a0and the first two\u00a0''Sepultura''\u00a0releases.\u00a0War metal bands include Blasphemy, Archgoat, Impiety, In Battle, Beherit, Bestial Warlust and Zyklon-B.\n== Fashion ==\nMetalhead fashion tends to be really simple; t-shirts in support of their favorite band (or bands), simple jeans, boots or sneakers, and possibly a leather jacket. Both male and female metalheads have a tendency to also keep their hair long with male metalheads growing massive facial hair (and, if they don't keep their hair long, they'll shave it all off). In modern days, it's not unusual for metalheads to be covered in piercings and tattoos as well (some will also dye their hair unnatural colors), but the core Metalhead fashion remains.\n\nWhen you get into the Black Metal end of the Metalhead spectrum, they'll take the aesthetic to a brand new level; often appearing dressed in black with combat boots, bullet belts, spiked wristbands and\u00a0inverted crosses\u00a0and inverted\u00a0pentagrams\u00a0to reinforce their anti-Christian or anti-religious stance. However, the most stand-out trait is their use of corpse paint\u2014black and white face paint sometimes mixed with real or fake blood, which is used to create a corpse-like or demonic appearance.\n\nAnother key factor of Metalhead culture is the art of crafting a \"battle jacket\" (sometimes referred to as a \"cut-off\" if the sleeves have been removed. Some may choose to leave the sleeves on, but this is not common). This involves buying a denim/leather jacket (though other articles of clothing have been known to be decorated in this fashion) and covering it in various patches of different band logos, albums, and motifs. Some Metalheads will make an effort to buy their patches directly from the bands, whether that be at a concert merch table or at an officially licensed online shop to support the bands. Alternatively, some may choose to hand paint or sew their patches, or just buy them from random retailers. These choices are entirely dependent on the person.\n\n== Activities ==\n* Attending metal concerts\n* Watching metal music videos\n* Contributing to metal publications\n* Drawing the logos of their favorite metal bands.\n\n== Metal-related Media ==\n\n* ''Headbanger's Ball''\n* ''That Metal Show''\n* ''Metalocalypse''\n*''This Is Spinal Tap''\n*''Wayne's World'' (''and Wayne's World 2'')\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\n\n<gallery widths=\"135\" orientation=\"landscape\">\n200px-Hindvir Gaulhammer Fest 111008 01 C.jpg|An example of the \"Black Metal\" aesthetic\nBlack metal.jpeg\nImages-0.jpeg\nOooooooooh goodies.jpg|Battle jackets and vests covered in patches of your favorite bands and albums are a core feature of the metal community\n628.jpg|Album cover of Darkthrone's \"Under a Funeral Moon\"\nFile:Heavymetal.jpg\nFile:Heavymetal1.jpg\nFile:Heavymetal2.jpg\nFile:Heavymetal3.jpg\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Music]]\n[[Category:Visual]]\n[[Category:Fashion]]"}}}]}}}}
