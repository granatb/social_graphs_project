Breakcore is characterized by the usage of heavy kick drums, deep bass, odd time signatures, \"scattered breaks\" put in a random rhythmic fashion, and samples of popular songs to classical music played at high tempos (180-190 BPM).  \n\n\n\n\n\n=== Artists ===\n*CDR\n*Venetian Snares\n* Squarepusher\n* Alec Empire\n* Aphex Twin\n* Nero's Day At Disneyland\n* Lauren Bousfield\n* Kid606\n* Terminal 11\n*Frums\n*Sewerslvt\n*Goreshit\n*Ghost and Pals\n*Cristoph Fringeli\n*Base Force One\n*homicidegirls\n*MARETU\n*Machine Girl\n*Igorrr\n*Emma Essex (Renard)\n*Christoph De Babalon \n*Atari Teenage Riot\n*Sonic Subjunkies \n*Nanoray\n*Bogdan Raczynski\n*Doormouse\n*Drumcorps\n*Sickboy\n*Knifechophand\n*Shitmat\n*Dev/Null\n*Golden Boy\n*Aaron Spectre\n*Xanopticon \n*Belladonnakillz\n*Bomg-ra\n*Enduser\n*Hellfish\n*Harmful Logic\n*Loli in early 20s\n*KFC Murder Chickens \n*Lofficiamcore\n*Metaroom\n*Acetantina \n*Denham Audio\n*Borai\n\n\n\n== History ==\nAs the early days of \"hardcore techno\" or just \"hardcore\" began to settle in Europe, breakcore as a genre began to take more concrete forms in other parts of the world. Inspired by new labels such as Addict, from Milwaukee, USA; Peace Off from Rennes, France; Sonic Belligeranza from Bologna, Italy; and\u00a0Planet Mu, from London, the genre began to take a new shape, adding in more elements of\u00a0mashup\u00a0and\u00a0IDM\u00a0to the hardcore and drum n' bass sounds. Each of these labels began to put aspects of their own social and aesthetic scenes into their music, allowing for an even broader definition of what was possible in music. In\u00a0''Notes on Breakcore'', Society Suckers explained that breakcore grew out of the mid-1990s\u00a0acid techno\u00a0rave culture\u00a0and disdain for\u00a0Neo-Nazis\u00a0and their associated\u00a0early hardcore (gabber).\n\nIn Europe, the breakcore genre was solidified by raves and club events such as Belgium's '''Breakcore Gives Me Wood''',\u00a0featuring local acts such as\u00a0UndaCova\u00a0and\u00a0Sickboy; '''Breakcore A Go Go''', in the Netherlands, which was run by FFF and Bong-Ra; as well as Anticartel, in\u00a0Rennes, the seat of PeaceOff, and later,\u00a0Wasted,\u00a0in Berlin and Bangface in London.\n\nBreakcore has been subject to changing and branching. Many newer breakcore artists (such as\u00a0Mochipet and later Venetian Snares) focus on melodic progressions (to classical music composition) and complex drum programming while other artists still focus on distorted and cut hardcore breakbeats, other than dark-edged musical influences (such as\u00a0heavy metal and\u00a0industrial). The artist\u00a0Venetian Snares\u00a0has produced breakcore blended with elements of\u00a0classical music, in its later phase.\u00a0Other artists such as\u00a0Shitmat,\u00a0Sickboy,\u00a0DJ Scotch Egg, and\u00a0Drop the Lime take another direction towards mash-up,\u00a0happy hardcore, and\u00a0rave\u00a0to make a lighter, more humorous sound. The rise of\u00a0chiptune\u00a0music has also blended with breakcore with artists such as\u00a0Tarmvred. \n\nThe UK\u00a0Free Party\u00a0scene has also expressed a large interest in producing and distributing its takes on breakcore, with crews and labels such as Life4land, Hekate, Headfuk, and Bad Sekta helping to push the scene and sound forward, as well as bringing over several international artists to play at their parties and club nights. Breakcore is steadily gaining in popularity, and aspiring artists are found scattered across the Internet.\n\nIn\u00a0''Breakcore: Identity and Interaction on Peer-to-Peer'', sociologist Andrew Whelan notes that\u00a0Venetian Snares\u00a0has become \"synonymous with breakcore such that alternative styles are being sidelined.\"\u00a0He adds that breakcore is the best example of a music genre whose development is intrinsically linked to online and peer-to-peer distribution.\n\n== Characteristics ==\nThe most defining characteristic of breakcore is the drum work, which is often based on the manipulation of the\u00a0Amen break\u00a0and other classic jungle and hip-hop breaks, at high\u00a0BPM. The techniques applied to achieve this differs from musician to musician, some preferring to cut up and rearrange the breaks, while others merely distort and loop breaks or apply various effects such as delay and chorus to alter the break's timbre. \n\nMelodically, there is nothing that defines breakcore clearly. Classic rave sounds such as\u00a0acid\u00a0bass lines,\u00a0Hoovers,\u00a0and Reese bass are common, but breakcore is mostly known for sampling sounds from all over the musical spectrum to accommodate the frantic and fast-paced nature of the rhythm section. Around the turn of the century, more and more breakcore musicians began employing traditional synthesis techniques to compose elaborate melodies and harmonies. There are a growing number of musicians who make use of recorded live instrumentation in their music. These musicians include Istari Lasterfahrer,\u00a0Hecate,\u00a0Benn Jordan, Ruby My Dear, Q\u00fcatros,\u00a0Venetian Snares, and\u00a0Igorrr.\n\nAccording to\u00a0Simon Reynolds\u00a0of\u00a0''The New York Times'', breakcore is \"purveyed by artists like\u00a0DJ/Rupture\u00a0and Teamshadetek. The music combines rumbling bass lines, fidgety beats, and grainy\u00a0ragga\u00a0vocals to create a home-listening surrogate for the\u00a0''bashment''\u00a0vibe of a Jamaican sound system party. Others within the breakcore genre, like Knifehandchop,\u00a0Kid 606,\u00a0and Soundmurderer, hark back to rave's own early days, their music evoking the rowdy fervor of a time when huge crowds flailed their limbs to a barrage of abstract noise and convulsive rhythm. It's a poignant aural mirage of a time when techno music was made for the popular vanguard rather than a connoisseurial elite, as it is today.\"\n\nOne of the most controversial issues in breakcore is that of the mere existence of the genre. Because it pulls liberally from other musical genres, there is not a consensus on what is and what is not breakcore, or even over the usefulness of the term itself.\n\n== Influences ==\nIn London, DJ Scud co-founded \u00a0Ambush Records with fellow producer Aphasic to focus on more extreme noise-oriented hardcore\u00a0drum and bass. Some artists released on Ambush are Christoph Fringeli, Slepcy,\u00a0The Panacea, and Noize Creator. \"Scud and Nomex tracks like 'Total Destruction' helped create the blueprint for much of breakcore's sound, a high-bpm mash-up of hyperkinetic, post-jungle breaks, feedback, noise, and Jamaican elements paired with a devil-may-care attitude towards sampling that pulls from the broadest musical spectrum of styles (hip-hop, rock, industrial, pop, and beyond).\"\n\nAt the same time,\u00a0Bloody Fist Records\u00a0based in\u00a0Newcastle,\u00a0Australia\u00a0released many records of\u00a0hardcore/gabber,\u00a0industrial, and\u00a0noise. Artists signed to Bloody Fist in its lifetime include Syndicate, Xylocaine, Epsilon, and\u00a0Nasenbluten. Label founder Mark Newlands said, in 1997, \"I think that the uncomfortableness also comes from a reaction towards the mainstream and popular culture that's constantly shoved down our throats, that's forced on the people via television, radio, mass media, etc. I think that also fuels the fire and keeps the aggressiveness there and the uncomfortableness.\" \u00a0\n\nNewlands described their music as products of \"cut'n'paste\u00a0mentality\" and an industrial environment. In her\u00a0''Experimental Music'', Gail Priest credits the label as recognized globally for its contributions to the breakcore genre,\u00a0and for spurring its 1990s development.\u00a0The Bloody Fist sound became breakcore from what was the\u00a0noise genre, with added elements of high\u00a0beats per minute\u00a0and \"extreme, thick, low-fi textures\".\u00a0By way of example,\u00a0Nasenbluten's 1996\u00a0''Fuck Anna Wood''\u00a0exemplified this style with controversial\u00a0public affairs\u00a0audio samples\u00a0collaged into dialogue atop\u00a0early hardcore\u00a0beats.\n\nFormed in 1994,\u00a0Digital Hardcore Recordings\u00a0released music by artists such as\u00a0Alec Empire,\u00a0Shizuo,\u00a0Atari Teenage Riot,\u00a0EC8OR,\u00a0and Bomb20, shaping the breakcore sound.\u00a0This label is also responsible for\u00a0Digital Hardcore, a genre developed simultaneously to breakcore. The Alec Empire album\u00a0''The Destroyer''\u00a0is often noted as the first breakcore album.\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nFile:Kitcaliber - HALCYONDAZE.jpg\nFile:Machine girl.jpg\nFile:Goreshit - semantics.jpg\nFile:Breakcore gives me wood posters.jpg\nFile:Sewerslvt-2.jpg\nFile:Somatic responses - circumflex.jpg\nFile:Sub-version 004.jpg\nFile:Vice breakcore.jpg\nFile:Ultrabeatmasterbator.jpg\nFile:Harmful logic - grief seed.jpg\nFile:Venetian snares - detrimentalist.jpg\nFile:Alec empire - bass terror.jpg\nFile:Enduser - 1-3.jpg\n</gallery><br />\n[[Category:Core Suffix]]\n[[Category:Music]]"}}}]}}}}
