While Grimoire, a shop, was influential in the creation of Dolly Kei, Dolly Kei itself is not very brand focused.\n\n==Fashion==\nAn outfit must have a vintage look to be considered Dolly Kei. It is also characterized by a dark appearance, layering, lace, embroidery, animal fur (usually faux), as well as large accessories based around creepy fairytales. Some argue that large accessories are the most important part of this style. The fabrics are usually heavy and in deep dark jewel-tones or black with a battered, worn, distressed appearance. \n\nDolly Kei outfits do not have to look cohesive. Clashing of patterns, colors, and accessories is encouraged. \n\nHairstyles tend to be natural and simple, with wavy hair and braids being common. Hair colors tend to be dark natural colors, including black, brown, and dark red. \n\n==Activities==\nWhile Dolly Kei is mainly based on visuals, there are some activities that are common amongst people that wear Dolly Kei.<ref>https://idontknowmuchbutimlearning.blogspot.com/2019/12/the-bygone-j-fashions-dolly-kei.html</ref>\n\n* Antique shopping\n* Collecting animal bones\n* Taxidermy\n* Thrifting\n\n== Resources ==\nExternal links to help get a better understanding of this aesthetic.\n\n=== Blogs ===\n\n* [https://dolly-kei.livejournal.com Dolly Kei Livejournal]\n* [https://fuckyeahdollykei-blog.tumblr.com/ Fuck Yeah Dolly Kei!]\n\n===Vendors===\n\n*[https://anutrof.thebase.in/ Anutrof]\n*[https://barrackroom.thebase.in/ Barrack Room]\n*[https://www.dangerousnude.com/ Dangerous Nude]\n*[http://grimoire.jp/ Grimoire]\n*[[wikipedia:Gunne_Sax|Gunne Sax]]\n*[https://kikiweb.kawaiishop.jp/ Kiki2]\n*[http://merryjenny.jp/ Merry Jenny]\n\n===Pinterest Boards===\n\n*[https://www.pinterest.com/etherealsoda/dolly-kei/ \u2730 dolly kei \u2730]\n*[https://www.pinterest.com/lamb_kei/dolly-kei/ \u1aa5Dolly kei\u1aa5]\n*[https://www.pinterest.com/art_of_misdirection/dolly-kei/ Dolly kei]\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"135\" orientation=\"portrait\">\nF69292c177debc01c60d1081c94193cb.jpg\nDollykei.PNG\nTumblr mfctnkHfXe1qk09zho2 1280.jpg\nDolly-kei-5.jpg\nDolly-kei-6.jpg\nDolly-kei-7.jpg\nDolly-kei-8.jpg\nDolly-kei-9.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n== References ==\n\n[[Category:Visual]]\n[[Category:Kei Suffix]]\n[[Category:Japanese]]\n[[Category:Fashion]]\n[[Category:Needs work]]\n[[Category:Feminine]]"}}}]}}}}
