It shouldn't be confused with [[Wizardcore]] or [[Witchcore]], as it rejects the muted imagery and [[Cottagecore]] stylings associated with those aesthetics. Magewave imagery is bright and fantastical; the cabalistic gibbering of a withered greybeard, palms erupting with primordial, elemental force -- oh! A warlock, pointed hat raised high to the heavens, siphoning the raw energy of the ley line for a ritual.\n\n== Visuals ==\nMagewave is primarily rooted in fantasy art from the latter half of the twentieth century. It is often cluttered, brightly colored, and highly kinetic, and may take inspiration from psychedelic art. Often, magewave includes elemental magic, such as the conjuration of fire or lightning. Astronomical imagery, such as stars, planets, and nebulae, may be associated with magewave. Elements of classic tabletop fantasy and dungeon crawling may also be present. Though pointy hats, bushy eyebrows, and flowing white beards are not strictly necessary, they are a hallmark of the aesthetic. Other examples of magewave visuals include: \n\n* Implements of magical power (staves, orbs, wands, etc.)\n* Flowing robes\n* Mythical beasts, such as unicorns\n* Familiars, such as cats or owls\n* Castles and wizard towers\n* Dungeons\n* Runes\n* Crystals\n* Magical scrolls and tomes\n* Magic circles and other arcane diagrams\n\n== Music ==\nMagewave music tends to be up-tempo, conveying a certain sense of power, much like the frenetic, diabolic magical eruptions of a gnarled swamp-crone. Power and symphonic metal are often well-suited to the Magewave aesthetic. However, the life of a wizard is not all fireballs and disintegration rays. The ponderous drone of dungeon synth is also an excellent reflection of the more mundane aspects of Magewave.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:Stargazing Wizard.jpg|A wizened mage in a resplendent, flowing robe gazes through the lens of an overengineered spyglass.\nFile:The-rainbow-wizard-bill-bell.png\n</gallery>\n\n[[Category:Wave Suffix]]"}}}]}}}}
