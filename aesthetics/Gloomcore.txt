The aim is to appreciate the quiet through dim surroundings. Those who take a liking to such genre tend to find beauty in cloudy skies, foggy coastlines and tall, endless, green forests. Gloomcore folks love all things odd and otherworldly.  \n\n== Visuals ==\nForests with moss, lots of plants, tall trees, and fog covering up the tops of the trees are the noticeable things you can find in forests that aren't bustling with energy or have any crowded spaces. Another good example is a hazy beach with no sun anywhere to be seen, just light brown sand and water with slow, grey waves stretching for miles.\n\nAs said in the description, most places revolve around forests and beaches. Though there also might be rivers, streams, lakes, and other bodies of water, even puddles! Moors, mountains and other landforms where you can overlook a beautiful view are also appreciated natural aspects of Gloomcore. People who associate themselves with this aesthetic tend to focus on irregular and wondrous things or ideas, like the angle of light on water, cryptid sightings and long forest walks.\n\nThe weather is supposed to have mellow, sort of dreamy undertones that possibly lead to long thought processes and the bubbling of one's imagination. Though something like the rain, cold seasons, fall, winter, thunderstorms and lightning storms are prevalent, quiet foggy days count as well.\n\n== Fashion ==\nThe clothes must be related to the dull, mysterious atmosphere and cold weather. Some of the items are:\n\n* Oversized, loose fitting clothing\n* Pullover sweaters\n* Corduroy pants and jackets\n* Mom jeans\n* Vintage graphic tees\n* Overall pants/shorts\n* Pleated skirts\n* Ripped/patterned tights\n* Leg warmers\n* Combat/hiking boots\n* Slip on converse or vans\n* Argyle sweater vests\n* Raincoats\n\n== Hobbies ==\n\nAlthough the most prominent activity in Gloomcore is enjoying spending one's time looking at the aspects of nature, there are other things, such as:\n\n* Gardening\n* Reading\n* Writing\n* Photography\n* Sketching or painting natural scenes\n* Cryptid hunting\n* Collecting cute/weird objects\n\n== Music ==\n\nBecause of the nature this aesthetic is based on, Gloomcore music is soft, based on the ideas of being in nature and other Gloomcore hobbies. Of course, the perfect music would be something mysterious and soft, perfect to meditate or \"gloom\" to.
