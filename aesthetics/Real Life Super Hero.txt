The aesthetic has a small relation to [[Kidcore]], in the sense that it ties into a child-like notion of justice and wanting to do right. \n\n\n== Visuals ==\nOftentimes, the aesthetic will put out promotional material for their superhero endeavors that invoke the aesthetics of a comic book itself.  While generally, members of the Real Life Super Hero aesthetic put on the costume and just go out and be Good Samaritans, there have been members of the movement who actually got trained in the martial arts to actually fight crime, which they often get criticized for due to it being viewed as a form of vigilantism; the most infamous example of this being Phoenix Jones, who was known to get incredibly physical with criminals he was busting before he, himself, turned out to be a criminal in his own right after his recent arrest due to being caught with possession of cocaine with intent to sell; becoming the very thing he used to fight against.\n== Fashion ==\n\n* Spandex\n* Masks\n* Tactical gear (often painted up in bright colours)\n* Capes\n* Trench-coats\n* Fedoras or any other sort of comic book characters\n\nMasks in particular are necessary to protect the civilian identities in case they have a run-in with the law or with particularly violent criminals.\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery widths=\"135\">\nPhoenixjones1.jpg|Phoenix Jones: perhaps the most infamous figure in the Real Life Super Hero movement.\nThe Fall of Phoenix Jones\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Visual]]\n[[Category:Fashion]]\n[[Category:Needs work]]"}}}]}}}}
