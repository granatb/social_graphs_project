Unlike Cottagecore (which has, for the most part, a \"cleaner\" look), Rusticcore openly embraces the grit, dirt, and grime that often is associated with farm life and rural living and giving it a sort of [[Grunge]] vibe.\n\n== Fashion ==\nColors and clothing in the aesthetic include: very plain, fall colors, warm colors along with plaid and denim.  A lot of Rusticcore fashion shares some overlap with Grunge, since a lot of original Grunge fashion was clothing that farmers and people like that wore because the clothing was intended to be long-lasting to be able to handle the wear and tear of the rigors of working on the farm.\n\n== Music ==\nA lot of Rusticcore music involves folksy, acoustic music and has generally a loose, improvisational feel to it, like a bunch of friends gathered together on the front porch with whatever they could find and just have a jam session.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"130\">\n\nJhvjhvfvhwqrwr.jpg\nFile:Ejrbkhfbvhfveafverv.jpg\nFile:Dkfb whjbfvhewbfv.jpg\nFile:Hvjgchgcgcgcg.jpg\nFile:Qwrjbqhjbhjerv.jpg\nFile:Qwkjbrfhjwbhjbwrjfbwrv.jpg\nFile:Qwlrngqjkebrghkqerg.jpg\nFile:Kjtbjwkrbjbt.jpg\nFile:Qwbfjqhbrhqberfg.jpg\n\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Visual]]\n[[Category:Core Suffix]]\n[[Category:Fashion]]\n[[Category:Music]]\n[[Category:Masculine]]"}}}]}}}}
