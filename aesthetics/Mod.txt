Focused on music and fashion, the subculture has its roots in a small group of stylish\u00a0London-based young men in the late 1950s who were termed\u00a0modernists\u00a0because they listened to\u00a0modern jazz. Elements of the mod subculture include fashion (often tailor-made suits); music (including\u00a0soul,\u00a0rhythm and blues,\u00a0ska, jazz, and\u00a0freakbeat); and motor scooters (usually\u00a0Lambretta\u00a0or\u00a0Vespa). The original mod scene was associated with\u00a0amphetamine-fuelled all-night dancing at clubs.\n\n== Mod Revival ==\nMod revival\u00a0was a\u00a0music genre\u00a0and\u00a0subculture\u00a0that started in England in 1978 and later spread to other countries (to a lesser degree). The\u00a0mod\u00a0revival's mainstream popularity was relatively short, although its influence lasted for decades. The mod revival post-dated a\u00a0Teddy Boy\u00a0revival, and mod revivalists sometimes clashed with Teddy Boy revivalists,\u00a0skinhead\u00a0revivalists,\u00a0casuals,\u00a0[[Punk|punks]]\u00a0and rival\u00a0gang\u00a0members.\n\n== Fashion ==\n===Feminine===\n* Straight or A-line dresses worn above the knee in fabrics that hold their shape\n*Geometric shift dress (example: the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mondrian_collection_of_Yves_Saint_Laurent Mondrian dress])\n*Op Art prints\n*Bold, geometric patterns like British flags, polka-dots, and stripes\n*Mid-calf white go-go boots with pointed toes and flat heels\n*Chelsea boots\n*Mary Janes\n*Low kitten heels and flats\n*Plastic-belted trench coat\n*Knitted jersey mini-dresses with opaque and colorful tights\n*\"Wet look\" PVC coats\n*Skinny-rib knitted sweaters in stripes or solid bright block colors\n*Patent-leather square-toed shoes and pilgrim shoes with buckles\n*Bold white/blue/gray eye shadow applied all over the eyelid\n*White/nude lipstick or lips painted over with pale matte foundation\n*Groomed natural eyebrows\n*Thick black winged eyeliner applied all the way around the eye\n*Thick mascara or doll-like false eyelashes\n*Sheepskin coats\n* Suede/leather mini-coats\n*Dresses with low-slung, wide loops to hold a hipster belt\n*Plain or button-up A-line miniskirts worn with sandals in warmer months and knee-high boots in colder months\n* Tunic dresses worn over polo-neck sweaters\n*Ankle-length bell-bottom trousers\n*Beehive hair or short bob with bangs\n* \"Five point\" Vidal Sassoon haircut: a short, angular five pointed pixie cut.\n*Large plastic bracelets\n*Huge round plastic earrings clipped on the ear\n*Lucite rings with polka dots\n*Big or small boxy over-the-shoulder handbags in bright colors, or geometric designs\n*Clear/white painted almond-shaped nails\n*Peter Pan collars\n\n===Masculine===\n*Tailor-made three-button black/grey/brown suits with narrow lapels, vests, and pocket squares\n*Thin ties\n*Button-down collar shirts\n*Wool/cashmere jumpers (crewneck or V-neck)\n*Chelsea or Beatle boots\n*Clarks Desert lace-up boots\n* Oxfords\n*Levis jeans, shrunk to fit\n*Slim-fit chinos or tapered trousers\n* Either a Fred Perry polo shirt or John Smedley knit polo shirt buttoned all the way to the top\n*Turtleneck\n*Green/tan parka to protect your outfit while riding on your scooter\n*Newsboy caps\n*Brightly striped boating blazers\n*Harrington jacket\n*Shaggy hair or a bowl haircut\n*Buttons from mod bands and British flag pins\n*Round glasses\n\n===Designers===\n*[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Quant Mary Quant]\n*[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caroline_Charles Caroline Charles]\n*[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marion_Foale Marion Foale]\n*[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sally_Tuffin Sally Tuffin]\n*[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paco_Rabanne Paco Rabanne]\n*[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr\u00e9_Courr\u00e8ges Andr\u00e9 Courr\u00e8ges]\n*[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudi_Gernreich Rudi Gernreich]\n*[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yves_Saint_Laurent_(designer) Yves Saint Laurent]\n*[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Cardin Pierre Cardin]\n\n===Stores===\n\n*[https://baitfootwear.com/ B.A.I.T.
