Raves are an organized\u00a0dance party\u00a0at a\u00a0nightclub,\u00a0outdoor festival,\u00a0warehouse, or other private property typically featuring performances by\u00a0DJs, playing a seamless flow of\u00a0electronic dance music. DJs at rave events play electronic dance music on vinyl, CDs, and digital audio from a wide variety of genres, including\u00a0techno, hardcore,\u00a0house,\u00a0bassline,\u00a0dubstep, New Beat,\u00a0and\u00a0post-industrial. Ravers commonly wear clothing that is bright and/or neon coloured.\n\n== Origins==\nIn many ways, the Madchester scene laid the groundwork for today's raver aesthetic. '''Madchester''', the predecessor to modern raver culture, is a musical and cultural scene that developed in the English city of Manchester in the late 1980s. It saw artists merging alternative rock with elements of acid house, rave music, psychedelia, and 1960s pop. Madchester's decline gave way to the [[Britpop]] sound that became popular in the mid-to-late 90's thanks to bands like Blur and Oasis. Madchester was known for having a very rich drug scene, with the popular drug of choice being ecstacy (aka MDMA/Molly/E); in fact, Madchester band The Shamen put out a song called \"Ebeneezer Goode\" which was coded to be all about dropping E.\n\n==Fashion (most commonly worn/suggested) ==\nMadchester fashion is the main reason for another name for the genre; Baggy. Baggy pants and shorts were quite popular back in Madchester's heyday and were often accompanied by tie-dye shirts of some sort. It can best be described as equal parts raver, hippie/retro (for its time), and football hooligan.  Over time, however, as Madchester/raver culture became more mainstream, raver fashion moved away from the warehouse parties into more extensive venues and outdoor spaces. Some of the new raver fashion that's come about includes:\n\n*Kandi\n*Comfortable shoes\n*Breathable clothing\n*Backpack/fanny Pack\n*Hydration pack\n*Face mask/bandana\n*Sunglasses\n*Face glitter and jewels\n*Neon/UV reactive gear\n*Fluffy hoodies\n*Glow-in-the-dark accessories\n\n=='''Music'''==\nThere are multiple genres of music that have their association with the Raver aesthetic, such as:\n\n==='''Drum 'n Bass'''===\n'''Drum and bass''' (also written as Drum&Bass or drum'n'bass and commonly abbreviated as D&B, DnB, or D'n'B) is a genre of electronic music characterised by fast breakbeats (typically 165-185 beats per minute) with heavy bass and sub-bass lines, samples, and synthesizers. The genre grew out of the UK's jungle scene in the early 1990s. There have also been many subgenres and fusions of DnB. Artists include:\n\n*''' Goldie \n*''' Roni Size\n*''' Alex F\n*''' Photek\n*''' Squarepusher\n*''' Shy FX\n*''' Groovedriver\n*''' DJ Hype\n*''' Metrik\n*''' Sully\n*''' The Prodigy \n*''' High Contrast\n*''' Amon Tobin\n*''' Ed Rush & The Optical \n*''' Plug\n*''' U-Ziq\n*''' Black Empire Sun\n*''' Skynet\n*''' Konflict\n*''' Sub Focus\n*''' Aphex Twin\n*''' A Guy Called Gerald\n*''' The Third Eye Foundation\n*''' Cycheouts\n*''' 4hero\n*''' LTJ Bukem\n*''' Christoph De Babalon \n*''' Chase & Status\n*''' Pendulum \n*''' Source Direct\n*''' Lemon D\n*''' Dillinja\n*''' Origin Unknown \n*''' 2 Bad Mice\n*''' Goreshit \n*''' Sewerslvt\n\n*Classic 90's DnB: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwI0gbGEyuI\n*Jazz Fusion DnB (Nu-Jazz): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4zGRmrG20w\n*Dark Ambient DnB: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bhu8LygGWUI\n*Intelligent DnB: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IN48khbyVzM\n*Liquid DnB: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuvLac2pykY\n*Atmospheric DnB: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgFaK6ZQifE\n* Jump-Up DnB: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_altBSbl8M\n\n===EDM===\n''Under construction''\n\n=== Future Bass ===\n'''Future Bass''' is an umbrella term for a genre or technique in electronic dance music emphasizing modulated synthesizer bass sounds.  The sound waves are often modulated using automation or low-frequency oscillation controlling the cutoff of an audio filter (typically a low- or high-pass filter), or the wave's amplitude, to adjust the waveform (to create a \u2018wobbly\u2019 effect on its parameters). In addition, it is common to utilize a somewhat \"twinkly\"-sounding gradual rise in pitch during \"risers\" (gradual pre-drop buildups of white noise), and arpeggio chords, vocal chops, or vocoders. Artists include:\n\n* Wave Racer\n* Porter Robinson\n* Flume\n* RL Grime\n* Lido\n* Cashmere Cat \n* The Chainsmokers\n* Louis the Child\n* Marshmello\n* Martin Garrix\n* Mura Masa\n* Boombox Cartel\n*Slushii\n\n===Hardcore===\n'''Hardcore''' (better known as hardcore techno) is a subgenre of electronic dance music based on the Belgian New Beat industrial style of Techno, which originated in the Netherlands in the 1990s. It is distinguished by faster tempos (160 to 200 BPM or more), the intensity of the kicks and the synthesized bass (in some subgenres), the rhythm and the atmosphere of the themes (sometimes violent), the usage of saturation and experimentation close to that of industrial dance music. It would spawn subgenres such as gabber.\n\n===Jungle===\n''Under construction''\n\n===Madchester===\nAs described above, '''Madchester''' music combined alternative rock with acid house, techno, psychedelica and the 1960's pop sound, with some of the big bands in the scene primarily coming from Manchester (hence the name). The music first started gaining headway from a club called the Ha\u00e7ienda (owned by members of legendary New Wave band New Order) and kicked off what came \nto be known as The Second Summer of Love. Bands within the genre include:\n\n*Happy Mondays\n*The Stone Roses\n*Inspiral Carpets\n*The Shamen\n*EMF\n*The Charlatans\n*808 State\n*The Mock Turtles\n\n[[File:The Shamen, Phorever people, Directed by Richard Heslop, 1992|thumb|330x330px|If you need Madchester distilled into video form... here you go.]]\nIt was being predicted at the time that Madchester would become the defining sound of the 90's, but other genres (such as [[grunge]]) prevented it to ever happen. The Madchester sound eventually gave way to the rise of shoegaze and britpop; so while Madchester didn't become the decade-defining sound, it did continue to be an influential genre of music in its own right.\n\nAs time went on, however, the psychedelica and indie rock vibes started falling away from the raver sound in favor of a more purely electronic sound, which gave rise to techno, trance, jungle, drum 'n bass, and so on, arriving into the era of modern EDM, which can be separated into its subgenres.\n\n=== Mainstream Hardcore===\n'''Mainstream Hardcore''' is a subgenre of hardcore techno. The essence of mainstream hardcore sound is a distorted bass drum sound, overdriven to the point where it becomes clipped into a distorted square wave and makes a recognizably melodic tone. \n\n===Riddim ===\n''Under construction''\n\n===Techno===\n''Under construction''\n\n=== Trance===\n''Under construction''\n\n== Media ==\n\n===Movies===\nThe Madchester scene has inspired numerous movies, chief among them being 24 Hour Party People (2002) and Trainspotting (1996).\n\n== Resources ==\nExternal links to help get a better understanding of this aesthetic.\n\n'''Vendors'''\n\n*[https://www.intotheam.com/ Into The AM]\n*[https://www.iheartraves.com/ iHeartRaves]\n*[https://www.ravewonderland.com/ Rave Wonderland]\n*[https://iedm.com/ iEDM]\n*[https://www.raveready.com/ RaveReady]\n*[https://www.freedomravewear.com/ Freedom Rave Wear]\n*[https://www.oncueapparel.com/ On Cue Apparel]\n*[https://www.etereshop.com/ Etere] (prices are ''extremely'' high.)\n*[https://electrothreads.com/ Electro Threads]\n*[https://www.ultrapoi.com/ UltraPoi]\n*[http://www.kikwear.com Kikwear]\n*[https://www.shopufojeans.com/ UFO]\n*[https://www.set4lyfe.com/ Set4Lyfe]\n*[https://spacetribe.com/ Space Tribe]\n*[https://www.tetramode.com/ Tetramode]\n*[https://yourmindyourworld.com/ Your Mind Your World]\n*[https://www.electricstyles.com/ Electric Styles]\n*[https://www.shantibanti.com/ Shanti Banti]\n*[https://inlighten.co/ Inlighten]\n*[https://allovershirts.com/collections/lumi%20?rfsn=896323.96b75 All-Over Shirts by Lumi]\n*[https://theheadspace.net/ The Headspace]\n*[https://futuristiclights.com/ Futuristic Lights]\n\n===Playlists===\n\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3pDxuMpz94eDs7WFqudTbZ?si=lHQCAbIYSS6WrH7NzVmz4A The Sound of EDM Spotify playlist by The Sounds of Spotify]\n**[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4Pl3Kahwz3O2ouSYLv2a9h?si=Rj6jbtBySNyUBhDgv5vJ1A Intro to EDM]\n**[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2rKMohfPQEvrkY4hVU5XJr?si=_qA3vAIKTciAtYwOjo_5xg The Pulse of EDM]\n**[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4aUtBYWsTivkRMhAK1z9c8?si=GK2f_h1oQoKO9GSNPczaHQ The Edge of EDM]\n**[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2c9tj69QwwcNawW3RIZ2kZ?si=gAnVr9PbTiWeJ6yGXriykg A \u2640Filter for EDM]\n* [https://open.spotify.com/track/1Ua4TSAqWUjyahR38Zjx5I?si=b588oYGCRlyUHdjB0loEgw e-girl warehouse rave Spotify playlist by Ella Lautier]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2qjkt5b1wq8qq07PqKQwwN?si=CA_ZFeQPRVuxjoT9xYIZrw rEaL rAvEr Spotify playlist by Bigfeetbigballs]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3io3DpWtQzFKlOybiX0rrz?si=3d76fLbLQbC-T5DCmGC26w RAVER Spotify playlist by Simon Feuerpfeil]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4guXyhNMlvASzq3NuOryaC?si=7Ao7aHOFSCue8whFPGm4vQ dark raver Spotify playlist by grashof-esendam]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0xmvMVdvLSMqpmZ1Y8Ur3Q?si=Yw9n5ZLZTXaP2R9wC-kL5A wooks and ravers Spotify playlist by Tim Martin]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0b429Sr6jNM0wOshV38QgK?si=NyQhkm3nRMKR5hh7V79xfg TIKTOK RAVERS\ud83d\ude1c Spotify playlist by adele.tondu]\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery spacing=\"small\" orientation=\"none\" widths=\"130\">\nImage.jpeg\n</gallery>\n\n[[Category:Fashion]]\n[[Category:Visual]]\n[[Category:Music]]\n[[Category:Raver]]\n[[Category:Needs images]]"}}}]}}}}
