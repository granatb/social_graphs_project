Appeared on Tumblr between 2014 and 2015. Some photos are intended to be sad looking, of someone suffering for love or with a '90s vibe, for example.\n\nDespite calling themselves [[grunge]], their aesthetic was fairly popular in the mainstream and connected to the rise of the [[Alternative]], [[emo]], pop, and [[indie]] music and fashion trends of the time, such as galaxy print, black and white grids, and fandom merchandise. Because of their close-knit community on tumblr, they developed a \"not-like-other-girls\" attitude, especially in contrast with the \"hipsters\" (which is more accurately described as an early version of [[VSCO]]). The type of media they consumed was also incredibly specific, with fangirl culture and this aesthetic often overlapping. This style later declined, yet has gained short-term popularity in 2020 due to a desire to escape to the past.<ref>https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2020/5/7/21247938/tumblr-aesthetic-2014-nostalgia-tiktok-indie-pop</ref>\n\n<br />\n\n==Visual==\nThis aesthetic can be described as very fresh or a clean variation of the grunge style.

Japanese fashion, early 2000s emo, and more authentic grunge influenced the style, which has outfits that were incredibly specific, almost formulaic. Unlike grunge or the DIY ethos of other alternative fashions, these pieces were typically bought brand new at mall stores such as American Apparel and Hot Topic. Despite the term \"tumblr girl\" being the most popular term, men can wear the aesthetic too. Amusingly, these outfits are now associated with bisexuals, who likely used tumblr in their youth. Typical fashion pieces include:\n\n* Band and fandom printed t-shirts\n* T-shirts printed with patterns popular at that time, such as galaxy, horizontal stripes, and black and white grids\n* Plain black and white t-shirts\n* Flannels\n* Denim jackets\n* Cuffed jeans\n* Ripped jeans\n* Black skinny jeans (typically associated with the Hot Topic emo fans)\n* Pleated tennis skirts\n* Fishnet tights\n* Knee socks\n* Converse sneakers\n* Creepers\n* Combat boots\n* Vans shoes, often the black and white checks\n* Black plastic chokers and bracelets\n* Beanies\n* Flower crowns\n<gallery widths=\"130\" orientation=\"square\" spacing=\"small\">\nLook2.JPG\nLook3.jpg\nHolographic backpack.jpg\nGrid skirts.jpg\nJeans.jpg\nBackpacks.jpg\nIMG_20210222_005958.jpg\nIMG_20210222_010303.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==Websites & Stores==\n[[File:American apparel.jpg|thumb|The main store of the aesthetic]]\nStores that are popular among members of the Pale aesthetic community include:\n*Adidas\n*All Star\n*American Apparel\n*BLK Water\n*Boxed Water\n*Crosley Cruiser\n*Evian Water\n*Fiji Water\n*Nike\n*Voss\n*Zara\n\n<gallery widths=\"130\" orientation=\"square\" spacing=\"small\">\nAdidas aesthetic.jpg\nEvian.jpg\nBoxedwater.jpg\nBlackwater.jpg\nNike pale.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==Hair==\n[[File:Spacebuns.jpg|thumb|Space buns are two high buns.]]\nColoured or faded hair is great for this aesthetic, but natural hair also fits very well.
