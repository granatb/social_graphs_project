It is characterized by effects of light in the landscape, through the use of aerial perspective and the concealment of visible brushstrokes. Luminist landscapes emphasize tranquility and often depict calm, reflective water and a soft, hazy sky.\n\nLuminism shares an emphasis on the effects of light with Impressionism. However, the two styles are markedly different. Luminism is characterized by attention to detail and the hiding of brushstrokes, while impressionism is characterized by lack of detail and an emphasis on brushstrokes. Luminism preceded impressionism, and the artists who painted in a luminist style were in no way influenced by Impressionism.\n\nAs defined by art historian Barbara Novak, luminist artworks tend to stress the horizontal, and demonstrate the artist's close control of structure, tone, and light. The light is generally cool, hard, and non-diffuse; \"soft, atmospheric, painterly light is not luminist light\". Brushstrokes are concealed in such a way that the painter's personality is minimized. Luminist paintings tend not to be large so as to maintain a sense of timeless intimacy. The picture surface or plane is emphasized in a manner sometimes seen in primitivism. These qualities are present in different amounts depending on the artist, and within a work. Novak states that luminism, of all American art, is most closely associated with transcendentalism. The definitional difficulties have contributed to over-use of the term\n\n== Visual ==\n\n* <span class=\"s1\"></span>Cold, hard light (as opposed to soft, atmospheric light)\n* <span class=\"s1\"></span>No hint of brushstrokes\n* <span class=\"s1\"></span>Natural scenes (typically seascapes and river views)\n* <span class=\"s1\"></span>Tone to show atmosphere (instead of brushstrokes)\n* <span class=\"s1\"></span>Accurate rendition of a scene/landscape\n\n== Artists ==\nThere are many artists whose works show Luminism.
