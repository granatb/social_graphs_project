'''It is important to note that Progressive Academia should not considered a pure subset of the larger Academia family''', but more a deconstructed version of it, influenced by the Commonwealth movements for progressive university education and mid to late-1900s architectures. An example of a new progressive-styled university college is [http://studentguides.newcollege.utoronto.ca New College (Toronto)].\n\nProgressive Academia started with the foundation of New College at the University of Toronto in 1962. As such, it is a movement with its roots in Canada and the larger Commonwealth's evolving academic traditions, especially in the values of diversity and anti-conformity.\n\nProgressive Academia is a manifestation of the progressive movement in universities and in education-at-large, but it is important to note that Progressive Academia is still based around the tenets of [[Classic Academia]], while actively rejecting all \"restrictive\" views of this particular family of aesthetics, making it a syncretic position between more \"traditional\" and \"progressive\" aesthetics.\n\nPopular architectural styles are brutalist, or curvilinear architectures similar to the work of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Cardinal Douglas Cardinal].\n\n==Visuals==\nSpaces that are designed in a progressive academic manner usually conform to certain basic standards:\n\n#They must be simple in design, and conform with a general and traditional colour palette;\n#They must be either of a brutalist, or of a curvilinear architecture, or attempt to recreate those spaces in the most faithful manner possible;\n#They must be designed for maximum \"openness\" and not feel restrictive;\n# They must be designed with materials that complement one another (e.g. brick and wood, but not brick and plastic);\n#And they must be able to both function as a place for learning, a place for socialization, and a place for business at the same time.\n\n== Fashion==\nIf one wishes to dress in a progressive academic manner, it would be prudent to follow design rules 1, 3, and 4 (seen in the Visual section) when choosing an outfit.\n\n==Media==\n===Written===\n\n#''The International Handbook of Progressive Education'' by M.
