It alludes to elements such as rebirth, new beginnings, and renewal, and a more hopeful, optimistic vibe, after so many months of cold. The aesthetics that revolve around Spring are centered around motifs such as budding flowers and meadows, baby animals, sunshine, and a \"fresh\" and \"new\" feeling.  It can also be a reference to Spring fashion styles.\n\nWith the more flowery and colorful themes, this season is definetely more feminine-centric in many societies across the world, with all the promotion of \"cute\" motifs looks for women's wear, but this shouldn't stop men or non-binary folk to express a liking to Spring or join in with the trends.\n\n\n== Fashion ==\nThe new wave of heat makes it not too cold but not too hot to cause a lot of heat, so a blend of both light and heavy clothes is seen during this season.
