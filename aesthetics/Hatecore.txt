It involves hatred, anger, heartbreak, violent imagery, gore, and the feeling of rejection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n==Visual==\nHatecore visuals can include, but are not limited to:\n\n*Burning buildings\n*Blood and guts\n*Angry dogs\n*Corpses\n*Rot and decay\n*[[Glitch|Glitchy VHS]]\n*[[Trashcore|Abandoned buildings]]\n* Body mutations\n*[[Medicalcore|Surgical stuff]]\n*Bones\n*Dirt\n\nEssentially, if it can conjure up every bad feeling in the world, it applies to Hatecore.\n\n==Fashion==\nHatecore fashion draws a lot of inspiration from a mix of both [[Punk]] and [[Bastardcore]] fashions, designed solely to provoke anger, hatred, and potential violence from people around them by being as offensive as possible. Hatecore fashion may also make heavy use of the blood motif.\n\n==Music==\n\n===Spotify playlists===\n\n*[https://open.spotify.com/user/gixxer.x/playlist/2WE8xaAbh6hgb5JKbGFkhE Hatecore playlist by gixxer.x]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/user/4xzl5r90o4lx01zg6eohj3h9k/playlist/3rOlI6Z9bhU4ygzzhCV8XR Hatecore playlist by Lacika]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/user/drunkside2002/playlist/4LhAX1anPexUaYDDdUJQC1 hatecore playlist by drunkside2002]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/user/horsefishy/playlist/5SvO4EabKcXWJGJx3lfcap hatecore playtlist by horsefishy]\n\n==Subgenres==\n\n===Bloodcore===\n'''Bloodcore''' is an aesthetic centered around pictures of bloody faces/teeth/hands, people who think blood makes their subject look intimidating, and just paints an overall violent and bloody picture. \n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"130\">\n9b4d7ab60e264f61a9c3ae3e69e651e7.jpg\nScrapper Aesthetic 4.jpg\nFire-with-fire.jpg\nBloodlips.jpeg\nTracy.jpg\nCryptidcore Creepy House.jpeg\nKing-sword-blood.jpg\nDemon-angel.jpg\nBloody-knuckles.jpg\nE1D6035A-3F06-4035-8117-D2398F3451C4.png\nGothc-red-trees.jpg\nSouthern gothic.jpg\nBlack-dress-skull-long-hair.jpg\nRed-nails-cut.jpg\nWhite-angry-dogs.jpg\nFile:Redfleshblur.png\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Core Suffix]]\n[[Category:Visual]]\n[[Category:Music]]\n[[Category:Fashion]]\n[[Category:Sensitive Content]]"}}}]}}}}
