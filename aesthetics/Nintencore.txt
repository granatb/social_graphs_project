Nintencore is also used but not limited to mostly with nostalgic and happy things. Mostly seen paired with games like Animal Crossing, Pokemon, and Kirby\n\n== Visual ==\nNintencore is most commonly associated with more retro games, especially from the 8 and 16-bit era. Things such as pixel art and chiptune/SNES music are very common tropes. Because of the variety of different genres these games can fit, you could arguably branch Nintencore into multiple groups (RPGs, The Legend of Zelda, Kirby, etc.)\n\nMovies: \n\n* ''Scott Pilgrim vs. The World'' (2010)\n\n== Fashion ==\n''Under Construction''\n\n== Music ==\nNintencore music\u00a0is a broadly defined music genre that fuses\u00a0chiptune\u00a0and\u00a0video game music\u00a0with modern\u00a0hardcore punk,\u00a0heavy metal,\u00a0and various associated\u00a0rock music\u00a0style frequently features the use of\u00a0electric guitars,\u00a0drum kits, and typical rock instrumentation alongside\u00a0synthesizers,\u00a0chiptunes, 8-bit sounds, and electronically produced beats. It originated out of a diverse range of musical styles, including various forms of\u00a0hardcore punk and\u00a0heavy metal. In addition to these origins, notable Nintencore<nowiki> </nowiki>bands have been influenced by a variety of other genres, such as\u00a0post-hardcore,\u00a0metalcore,\u00a0electro,\u00a0noise rock, post-rock,\u00a0and\u00a0screamo.\n\nThus, Nintencore groups vary stylistically.\u00a0Horse the Band\u00a0combines metalcore, heavy metal,\u00a0thrash metal, and post-hardcore with post-rock passages. \"The Black Hole\" from Horse the Band's third album,\u00a0The Mechanical Hand, is an example of Nintencore, featuring screamed vocals, heavy \"Nintendo riffs,\" and \"sound effects from numerous games.\" Math the Band\u00a0includes\u00a0electro\u00a0and\u00a0dance-punk\u00a0styles. Minibosses\u00a0use\u00a0Kyuss-inspired heavy metal\u00a0riffing,\u00a0and The Advantage is associated with styles such as noise rock and post-rock. The Depreciation Guild\u00a0was an\u00a0indie\u00a0band that incorporated 8-bit sounds, video game music, and elements of\u00a0shoegaze.\n\nSome bands feature singing, such as The Depreciation Guild, whose<nowiki> </nowiki>frontman Kurt Feldman provides \"ethereal\" and \"tender vocals,\" and\u00a0The Megas, who write lyrics that mirror video game storylines. Others, such as Horse the Band and Math the Band, add screamed vocals into the mix.\u00a0But yet other groups are strictly instrumental, such as Minibosses,\u00a0and The Advantage.\u00a0While otherwise diverse, all Nintencore<nowiki> </nowiki>groups \"use specific instruments to mimic the sounds of Nintendo games.\"\n\n== Playlists ==\n\n* [https://open.spotify.com/user/2h5kosh1q4rj7za0slhc9qnld/playlist/00Rxqw39pKh9GpJOQcOgkc?si=CyX_tkaNQSekdWAVzLgq4g poggers gaming tunes \ud83d\udd79 by LOREI \u2606\u30df] \n*[https://open.spotify.com/user/grsh30ow8poctvdjawnngshic/playlist/5Ot7CxYBepK1XIBc2FyYoM?si=wAuC528tRH6Lm0UFY2VAHw MOM SAID IT'S MY TURN ON THE SWITCH by Haneli \u2661]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/user/wildgirl456/playlist/1Vm9jmDfYminlp6GG4RqmE?si=OPZlcfOORn6fzGtldtSR4Q nintendo - no thoughts head empty by \u2728k\u2728]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/31HzIxyYAezUzvogqtSSkb?si=b65b1c362caf4144 <nowiki>[\uff2e\uff49\uff4e\uff54\uff45\uff4e\uff43\uff4f\uff52\uff45] by ~\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc63~\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc66~</nowiki>]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3Xg3LDuYRXOBeCeewTUqF2?si=0946a61d37eb4766&nd=1 bubblegum]\n\n== Wiicore ==\n'''Wiicore''' is an aesthetic subgenre of Nintencore that is related to anything pertaining to the Nintendo Wii system; the most commonly seen Wii system is the 7th generation.
