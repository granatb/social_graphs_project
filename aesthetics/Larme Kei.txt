This will include interviews and citations.'' \n\nLARME magazine is a Japanese magazine founded in 2012 and described as a \"sweet and cute girl's fashion picture book.\" by Haruna Nakagoori. The target audience was cultured young women from the ages of 18-25, who would read and go to museums. A unique feature of the magazine is its editing style, with multiple props and illustrations being used to decorate the pages.<ref>https://mdpr.jp/fashion/detail/1244324</ref> The fashion magazine has a distinctly feminine style that balances kawaii and sexy elements, with multiple vintage-inspired pieces and interesting textures. In the West, the style is referred as \"larme kei,\" but that name is not recognized in Japan, and is instead referred to as \"girly fashion\" or by simply \"LARME fashion.\" <ref>https://purelamo.com/larme</ref>\n\n<br />\n\n== Visual ==\nThe scrapbook-style editing of the magazine, along with its stylized backgrounds, allows the fashion magazine to enhance its aesthetic beyond fashion. Multiple brands also do photo shoots and decorate their stores to express its girly concepts. \n\n* Bed imagery such as pillows and blankets\n* Chandeliers\n* Halloween issues set in dark mansions\n* Glitter\n* Makeup vials and palettes\n* Roses, peonies, and other flowers with romantic appearances\n* Simple sketches such as hearts, stars, and phrases in cursive\n* Sweets such as lollipops and patisseries in Japan. Ties into its \"cultural\" section which may feature cafe openings\n* Victorian and Rococo inspired furniture\n\n<br />\n\n== Fashion ==\nThe outfits in the magazine have fabrics, details, and styling guidelines that remain the same throughout the magazine's run, yet also utilize brand new and trendy items, which creates a strong brand identity that shows its currentness with its audience. \n\n'''Colors'''\n\nThe magazine's colors depended upon the theme the photospread was, with both monochrome pink or black, and maximalist multicolored bling. However, brands that follow the same style tend to use pink, black, off-white, red, and pastel colors; the more unusual spreads were based on more experimental vintage pieces.\n\n'''Fabric'''\n\n* Chiffon\n* Denim\n* Gingham\n* Faux Fur\n* Lace\n* Organza\n* Prints in floral, cherries, hearts, swiss dots, and animal print\n* Satin\n* Marabou feathers\n\n'''Tops'''\n\n* Camisoles or tube tops layered over simpler pieces\n*[[Kawaii]], almost [[Lolita]]-like blouses with ruffles, peter pan collars, and puffed sleeves\n* Off-the-shoulder tops\n* Sheer fabric or lace tops used for layering\n* Sweaters\n\n'''Bottoms'''\n\n* A-line skirts, typically used as a statement piece\n* Bell-bottomed pants\n* Pants designed to look like maxi skirts\n* Pencil skirts, sometimes designed to look like a garter belt was layered over it\n* Pleated skirts\n* Shorts in a high-waisted style\n* Tiered ruffle skirts\n\n'''Dresses'''\n\n* Slip dresses used in lingerie as a layering piece\n* Vintage-inspired dresses, such as 70s Prairie Revival and Victorian children's dresses\n\n'''Shoes'''\n\n* Ankle boots\n* Mary-Janes\n* Pumps \n*Shoes with pom-poms and fluffy fabric\n\n'''Accessories'''\n\n* Berets\n* BDSM-inspired harnesses\n*Chokers and simple necklaces\n* Earrings\n* Hair clips\n*Scrunchies\n* Socks paired with heels\n* Vintage-inspired fascinators\n*Statement purses, clutches, crossbody bags, or handbags\n\n== Hair and Makeup ==\nLarme magazine almost always features hair and makeup tutorials after the fashion sections, and maintains a similar look throughout the magazine.\n\nThe makeup is designed to look like one has finished crying, with heavy use of red, pink, and brown on the eyelids and under-eyes. Lips are pink and red, and there is a heavy use of blush. Unlike Western makeup trends, Larme magazine does not utilize contouring, eyeliner, or highlight, and instead gives a softer look. However, the eyes are often emphasized through specialized cosmetic contact lenses and false lashes to create a doe-like appearance. \n\nThe models almost always have bangs with soft waves, which can be put up in braided up-dos, pigtails, ponytails, and space buns. Those are often embellished by elaborate braids, with ribbons and hair clips to further decorate. Some salons have created even more elaborate styles based on this aesthetic, with ribbons forming a corset pattern between braids or locks of hair formed into a heart.\n== Subgenres==\nIn Japan (where the aesthetic is known as Girly), there are few particular subgenres of the look.\n=== Casual Girly ===\nA girly style with a casual atmosphere, often featuring denim miniskirts, shorts and sneakers. The outfits often include sweaters and hoodies with many frills and ribbons. It's a pop and energetic coordination.\n===Otona Girly===\nAs its name suggests, is a more mature girly style. Since it is targeted at older women, the clothes cover more skin than usual, and there are many feminine dresses and skirts with elegant ruffles and floral lace. However, the playful prints and accessories still empathize the girly cuteness.\n===Retro Girly===\nIt's a girly style based on wearing outfits that have a retro feeling. The outfits usually feature a tartan main piece in muted pastels or earth tones. Flared skirts and tri-fold socks are very popular.\n==Magazines==\n====LARME ====\nThe concept is \"sweet girly artbook.\" It is a magazine with a very cute atmosphere, often covered by girls in girly fashion on the cover. It often features freebies like eyeshadow make-up sets and paper with cute visuals.\n====Sweet====\nA magazine full of adult girly outfits that are not too sweet and a casual mix. The accessories such as pouches and bags are collabs with extremely cute fashion brands.\n====Bis ====\nWith the theme of girly beauty, it features a style with feminine elements that is a little mature.
