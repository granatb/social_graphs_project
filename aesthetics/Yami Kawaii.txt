It is part of Anti-Kawaii which adds opposing elements to typical the kawaii style in order to leave a greater impact. As the term can also be used as an adjective, its interpretation can vary a lot depending on the context as a character being described as Yami Kawaii can simply refer to their personality being dark and cute without visually representing the aesthetic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is often confused with the [[Gurokawa]] trend, which revolves around horror and gore, but Yami Kawaii has more of shoujo spin to it with many manga-style illustrations, and is ''not'' bloody or gory.\n\n<br />\n\n==Fashion==\n[[File:Genres_of_Kawaii-_Yamikawaii|thumb|219x219px|left]]\nWhile there are many ways that Yami Kawaii can be integrated into fashion, the most common seem to be dark casual outfits featuring motifs with opposing elements, like cute animals with negative texts, in the form of prints. There are also many medical accessories such as bandaid hair clips, syringe necklaces, and pill bracelets due to the nature of the aesthetic. \n\nMakeup is worn regardless of gender in Yami Kawaii in order to archive a sickly look by applying pink or red blush right under the eyes instead of the traditional use on the apple of the cheeks, and is often further exaggerated by enchanting the natural eye bag line. Lips are usually kept very simple but gradients are also very popular.\n\n<br />\n\n==Art==\n[[File:Menhera-chan.jpg|thumb|Menhera-chan]]\n===Menhera-chan===\nThe spread of Yami Kawaii is often credited to have been helped by the character and manga series \"[https://menhera-chan.tumblr.com/ Menhera-chan]\" in particular. It was first created in 2013 by the artist Bisuko Ezaki as a form of vent art character during his university entrance exams, but gained an unexpected amount of attention that led to an expansion into an own manga series as of 2014. \n\nBecause of the background of its creation, the story of Menhera-chan is not suitable for everyone due to its self-harm themes, and might even be misunderstood as romanticizing by those not familiar with the artist. The manga follows a group of magical girls who fight \"evil spirits\", which are symbolic for mental illness, in order to free people from their corruption. There's also short stories featuring the characters for the purpose of social commentary on current events in the real world.\n\nThe character and artist inspired many other people to use art as a creative outlet to break the silence regarding their suffering. However, in the recent years, there have been critical voices claiming the increasing popularity went over Bisuko Ezaki's head, fueled by his attempt to register Yami Kawaii as his trademark in 2017 as well as an increase in general drama and problematic remarks from the artist (an extensive summary can be found [https://togetter.com/li/1327770 here]).\n[[File:Kazuhiro hori spell.png|thumb|'Spell' - a work by Kazuhiro Hori]]\n\n=== Kazuhiro Hori ===\nA notable artist within this aesthetic is Kazuhiro Hori, not necessarily a pioneer in the spread Yami Kawaii, but an artist of the aesthetic nonetheless. His art includes nearly all key themes and usually encompasses traditional Japanese schoolgirls in disturbing situations and often involving harmless icons, such as teddy bears, engaging in ominous or dangerous activity. He also provides an example of the aesthetic's more realistically styled art, as opposed to the very anime-styled majority.\n\n==Music==\nPopularartists within Yami Kawaii include:\n*[https://open.spotify.com/artist/3xq3MnCQ3SLkSkaCF0TgOA CHICKwarp]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCflDx9f4QPqH8se-bgQ_IxQ/ Fanatic]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/artist/2RN5euWwgrbUGgNjhimw0y Mio Yamazaki]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/artist/0f7BHYYAQ7YXnV8WNtCcN8 Misola de Edison]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/artist/0FZn92qmQ4tpWLbGR26dBb R-Shitei]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/artist/5SqXB8u44XUCFfyQYAkx29 Strawberry Painkiller]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/artist/0P2Z5wcszouClMUPn1PZ9L Sylph emew]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/artist/79JgYJHiBUZcvYqOC5Zufn Takayan]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/artist/0PHf0oiic0xAnCrRuLTtHl Tuyu]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/artist/2ctX9NbBhrTcEF7dzYgZQe Yandoll]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/artist/5RqEh86PV3ZysqV7TCrfJV Yukueshirezutsurezure]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/artist/67B747RX4JBRjFntR5FlqJ Zenbu Kimo no Sei Da]\n\n\nVOCALOID is quite popular in this aesthetic as well.
