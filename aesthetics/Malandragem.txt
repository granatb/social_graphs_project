The exponent of this lifestyle, the\u00a0malandro\u00a0(masculine adjective), or \"bad boy\" (rogue, hustler, rascal, scoundrel, gangster), has become significant to Brazilian national identity as a\u00a0folk hero\u00a0or, rather, an\u00a0anti-hero.\n\nThis lifestyle can be seen portrayed in the character \"Agostinho Carrara\", from the Brazilian tv show \"A Grande Fam\u00edlia\". Furthermore, Malandragem is the central theme in a song by the same name, from the Brazilian singer C\u00e1ssia Eller. \nOne of the oldest symbols of Malandragem in Brazilian media is the character Jose \"Z\u00e9\" Carioca, an anthropomorphic  parrot created by Disney in the 1940s for their animated films ''Saludos Amigos'' and ''The Three Caballeros'' to depict the typical Malandro ''Carioca'' (a person resident in the state of Rio de Janeiro).\n[[File:Cassia Eller.png|left|thumb|230x230px|C\u00e1ssia Eller, during a live show of the song \"Malandragem\".]]\n[[File:Z\u00e9 Carioca.png|thumb|Z\u00e9 Carioca, symbol of the lifestyle Malandragem.]]\n<br />\n[[Category:Visual]]\n[[Category:Needs work]]\n[[Category:Brazilian]]\n[[Category:Music]]\n[[Category:Fashion]]"}}}]}}}}
