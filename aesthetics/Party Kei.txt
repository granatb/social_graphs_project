There is considerable confusion over what this style really entails: its first stages as drawn out by Vessey were similar to both Larme and Cult Party Kei, with delicate clothes in pastel colours and added indications of a birthday party theme. However, the style mutated in the years to follow: Vessey and her fanbase, the 'Confetti Club', now wear louder garments from Western brands such as Lazy Oaf, with party references becoming more overt and rainbows used as a common theme.\n\nSince Vessey is neither Japanese nor a fluent speaker of the language, there is controversy over her use of the Japanese 'Kei' suffix, usually attached to styles hailing from the specific Harajuku locale, to describe a fashion now made up of mostly Western brands. Vessey and her fanbase are frequent features on gossip boards such as lolcow.farms, where the fashion has been criticized for its inconsistent aesthetic.\n\n==Fashion==\n===Hairstyles ===\n[[File:\u2661 EASY PARTY KEI HAIR STYLES! \u2661|thumb|290x290px|A video that includes different Party Kei hair styles.]]\n* Pastel hair\n* Ribbons\n* Small hair clips\n\n==Pinterest==\n* [https://www.pinterest.com.mx/anaivaldesv/party-kei/ Party Kei]\n* [https://www.pinterest.co.uk/blosskitty/party-kei/ \u2661 party kei]\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"130\">\nPartykeithing.jpg\n5b53cbbee0aad7a7aa4b599b7ecd59c1.jpg\nParty kei.jpg\nParty_kei_outfit.jpg|party kei outfit\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\nhttps://aminoapps.com/c/alternative-fashion/page/item/party-kei-intro-to-j-fashion/X0D1_3rfXIgja7Wa8xKK1GmaElj4NdJEgM\n\n[[Category:Kei Suffix]]\n[[Category:Fashion]]\n[[Category:Visual]]\n[[Category:Needs work]]\n[[Category:Feminine]]\n[[Category:Cute]]\n[[Category:Candidates for Deletion]]"}}}]}}}}
