It is also based off [[Chaotic Academia]], [[Art Academia]], and [[Dark Academia]]. Internet Academia mostly started with the COVID-19 pandemic, causing students all around the world to stay at home and study/work from there. Despite this, Internet Academia can also refer to using the internet for studies and in classes pre-pandemic. This can involve doing research, making presentations, writing papers, and using e-books.\n<br /> \n==Visual==\nInternet Academia is related to images of study places, sketches and art, books, and internet things.
