This also includes GIFs, video games, and clip-art. This aesthetic expresses nostalgia for Internet culture of the mid-1990s to late 2000s (spanning roughly Windows 95 to the glory days of YouTube).\n\n\n\nOld Web's philosophical heart yearns for the days of uninhibited individualism of the old web, before the internet became streamlined and social media monopolized how people communicated, and web graphic design developed a stricter set of rules for the \"dos\" and \"don'ts\" for the sake of accessibility and marketing.\n\nMany Old Web screencaps and gifs come from archived Geocities websites made by amateur coders and animators. The limited nature of the internet contributed to old web graphics being a bit rough around the edges. Harsh website design choices, clunky animations, and pixel art are all defining traits of the old web aesthetic. \n\nAnother main visual aesthetic that this category follows is the rounded blue edge windows that old software on Windows XP archived, the sharp looking windows that software appeared on Windows 95/98, or the transparent background that Windows Vista is much known for (in terms of looks).\n\nThis may also include early 3D examples from Windows' screensavers or commercial, ads for any of Microsoft's product or even software that characterized the old Windows OS's.\n\n[https://www.cameronsworld.net/ Cameron's World] is a website put together to celebrate this aesthetic. [https://gifcities.org/ Gifcities] is a website where you can search for gifs that used to be on Geocities, or fit that style.\n\n[https://newagesoldier.com/ newagesoldier] is a website that contains [https://newagesoldier.com/windows-95-theme-for-windows-10/ Windows 10 themes] for Window 95, 98, XP, Vista and 7.\n==Music==\nOld Web, musically, relates itself audibly to [[Vaporwave]], since usually the people who follow this aesthetic are in major part responsible for the Vaporwave movement.\n\nThere's a genre that people who follow this aesthetic have created: The mockup bootup/shutdown screens.\n\n==Hobbies & Activities==\n[[File:Feandesign's OS & Program Mockup Compilation|330x330px|right]]\nSome potential activities and hobbies of the Old Web aesthetics include going to old webpages and using old avatar chat programs (like the infamous Worlds.com; an old chatting program that is largely abandoned these days save for a dedicated group of people who act like a Satanic cult to mess with newcomers who come in).  For those REALLY adventurous individuals in Old Web, there's always traveling the Deep Web, but be careful where you go on the Deep Web lest you stumble upon some potentially illegal content (though, to dispel the myths, no, not every website on the deep web is a hub for illegal pornography, hiring hitmen, and buying drugs, there are plenty of innocent sites on the Deep Web). '''Even with this note aside, please take caution while exploring the Deep Web. Do not click any suspicious links and use an antivirus software.'''\n\nAnother popular activity within the Old Web aesthetic is playing games that were popular at the time the Old Web aesthetic's period of prominence (such as The Sims\u2122)\n\n== Other Media and Games ==\n\n* Hypnospace Outlaw\n* Subserial Network\n* Secret Little Haven\n\n{| class=\"article-table\"\n|+\n'''ENA temptation stairway-''' https://youtu.be/juBv2XWnwt8<nowiki/>by Joel G\n'''ENA Auction day-''' https://youtu.be/xUwJWv38FpY<nowiki/>by Joel G\n|Examples of the videogame OST||[[File:Nhood1.mp3|center]][[File:Latin6.mp3|center]][[File:Buy1.mp3|center]]\n|+\n|Example of a remixed piece of the OST||[[File:SimsAesthetic.mp3|center|]]\n|}\n\n== Resources ==\nExternal links to help get a better understanding of this aesthetic.\n\n=== Playlists ===\n\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2HGmm1Avd5NuhqwYJsJY1h?si=APbfDgEwQgO_pok1ZZY6Zw webcore! \ud83c\udf08\ud83c\udf6d\ud83d\udca5 Spotify playlist by gaysinspace]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0pfknYHtAO2pqiFt2ywmcQ?si=I54MnP6KRAO3FyhIo6eiIw Webcore vibes \u2728 Spotify playlist Winniesauce]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6nSpnqiOMMuHNXcdnNODNI?si=Jg-ksYUwTRK4D_Vo7zLBKA webcore whore Spotify playlist by lydia_big_nose]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/46yGT115PJOZhPWNgFgb4Z?si=QakdBhlkQDWLqQPqvzQOvQ webcore Spotify playlist by \ud83e\udddc\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2s2LxrP508uOKK8MQ1Agsx?si=Z6sBJwMNRZm-5ggZxKcGBw webcore Spotify playlist by tsumaranaii]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2FrfCaEWBeqbF8dsq1YqWU?si=Pmcu715cQmG71RmXD5RFgw cyberspace Spotify playlist by impi]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4nua0csp0OEsgVFE5uCoo8?si=9gdqjlt2RWCJuO8JpJ69hg webcore by KITTY]\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"130\" orientation=\"none\">\nDragonite.gif\nKid safe site by minecr aft-dc2godt.gif\nCapture.JPG\nWelcome by minecr aft-dbn0m3k.gif\n5b9e13d4-bfdf-4ade-8b0c-048e68e009e2.octet-stream.gif\nCybercore.jpg\nAe10.jpg\nTumblr mo3rsei2QN1r0ix14o1 r1 400.gif\nTumblr ppxyr5SaN31v1zkr5o1 540.png\nTumblr pxhd92iiNv1rxs4y3o1 540.png\nTumblr ms2htbiLhc1sydj82o1 500.gif\nTumblr p916k86EmE1w989uoo1 400.png\nTumblr ostyz6tL2G1wuolyxo3 250.png\nTumblr ozxeskhNN51qzkrmbo1 250.png\nSims-arcade.png\nSims-greenbed.png\nSims-fountain.gif\nSims-pizza.png\nSims-circle.png\nSims-pool.png\nSims-gohere.png|This is an example of a Simswave image blending into Vaporwave territory\nSims-sauna.jpg\nSims-action.png\nSims-statue.jpg\nSufferParty.png\nAllYourBaseOldWeb.gif\nImage about kpop in icons by \u263b on We Heart It.jpeg\nPetita.jpg|dan\u00e7a do Cr\u00e9u VS.
