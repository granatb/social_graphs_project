The term, coined in 2005, is a fusion of ''ero'' (shortened from the English word \"erotic\", which has negative connotations in Japanese culture) and the lighter ''kawaii'', meaning \"cute\".\n\n\n\n\n\nNowadays, it mostly refers to anything erotic that was inspired by kawaii culture.\n\n==History==\nThe term was first used in public by the japanese singer Kumi K\u014dda as erokakkoii (\u30a8\u30ed\u304b\u3063\u3053\u3044\u3044, \"erotic cool\") to describe her artistic style. Many japanese women considered the word ero as something negative but found it acceptable to associate the word with kakkoii. Kumi gave further variations such as erokakkokawaii or the more well-known erokawa. With the increasing popularity of the singer in the following years 2006 and 2007, the term spread more and more artists such as the korean singer Ayumi Lee or Leah Dizon described Kumi as their influence in relation to fashion.\n\n==Visuals==\n\n*pink ecchi/hentai manga edits\n*heart locks\n*fashion harness\n*[[kawaii]] lingerie\n*[[Neko|cat ears]]\n\n== Music ==\n\n=== Artists ===\n\n* [https://open.spotify.com/user/o7u2ecxv6wd4cy3379o4edvbb GradNC]\n* [https://open.spotify.com/artist/77t00lrU1uk65snqAdoPnt Nightcore]\n* \n\n== Resources==\n\nExternal links to help get a better understanding of this aesthetic.\n===Vendors===\n\n*[http://atelier-s.jp/ Atelier S]\n*[https://fairytailor2.thebase.in/ Emuproject]\n*[https://invasion.club/ Invasion Club]\n*[https://predatorrat.com/ Predatorrat]\n*[https://www.salondarts.com/SHOP/238332/list.html Parfaite]\n*[https://moeflavor.com/ Moe Flavor]\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"135\" orientation=\"landscape\" bordercolor=\"#fb7cb4\">\nDAzBMkvUAAE0y9k.jpg\nChorker7.jpg\nSax.jpg\nCz9MHxdUUAABYHA.jpg\nErokawa_collar.jpg\n</gallery><gallery>\n\n\n\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Visual]]\n[[Category:Japanese]]\n[[Category:Needs work]]\n[[Category:Feminine]]\n[[Category:Sexy]]\n[[Category:Cute]]\n[[Category:Sensitive Content]]\n[[Category:Needs images]]"}}}]}}}}
