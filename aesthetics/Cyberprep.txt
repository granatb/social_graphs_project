The word is an amalgam of the prefix \"cyber-\", referring to cybernetics, and \"preppy\", reflecting its divergence from the punk elements of cyberpunk. A cyberprep world assumes that all the technological advancements of cyberpunk speculation have taken place but life is utopian rather than gritty and dangerous. Since society is largely leisure-driven, advanced body modifications are used for sports, pleasure and self-improvement.\n\n\n\n== Visual ==\nCyberprep aesthetics take the visuals often seen in Cyberpunk, but present it in more of a utopian lens and talking about how it could potentially benefit society as opposed to presenting the potential ethical issues that could arise from technological advancement.\n\n== Fashion ==\nWhile cyberpunk fashion is inspired by counter-cultural outfits, cyberprep clothing draws on [[New Wave]], [[Y2K]] aesthetic and contemporary fashion. In synth clubs it's common for women to wear leather jackets and mini dresses that display their own brain patterns, while men wear Hussar jackets like Adam Ant. Walk down the street and you'll see women in shiny, chrome pantsuits and men wearing coats embedded with circuitry resembling artistic embroidery.\n\n== Music ==\nInstead of [[Metalhead|Metal]] and Techno, cyberprep music is largely Synthpop, Synthrock and [[Synthwave]] like Missing Persons, Electric Youth, and Lazerhawk. Instead of gyrating to techno in a warehouse or BDSM club, cyberpreps dance to synthpop in a night club with hologram light shows.\n\n=== Artists: ===\n\n* Empire of the sun\n* Genki Rockets\n* Boom boom satellite\n* Perfume\n\n== Fiction ==\n* Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom by Cory Doctorow\n* Maneki Neko by Bruce Sterling\n*REEL by Sophie Renaudin\n*O Human Star\n*Manna by Marshall Brain\n* Halting State by Charles Stross\n*Plastic Memories\n*Memories of the Alhambra\n* Two Step by Warren Ellis\n* Bionic by Suzanne Weyn\n* Epic by Conor Kostick\n* Hieroglyph: Stories & Visions for a Better Future\n*A Certain Magical Index/A Certain Scientific Railgun by Kazuma Kamachi\n*Paprika by Satoshi Kon\n*Summer Wars by Mamoru Hosoda\n\n== Resources ==\nExternal links to help get a better understanding of this aesthetic.\n\n=== Playlists ===\n\n*[https://open.spotify.com/user/31ne3ncaxlsgaqno4kkb3fpeapgm/playlist/37bJIb839h7OFWYbI8XmJO Cyberprep/Post-Cyberpunk playlist by Luca Fagiani Runo]\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery widths=\"130\">\n63zwh9aujqq01.jpg\nZbacvztp0c701.jpg\nPdccptvatfh01.jpg\nSpace Lights.jpg\nStudio.jpg\nCyborg.jpg|A model with her bionic hand\nPhone charger.png\nMedia.jpg|From the webcomic always human\nCp aesthetic.jpg\n95e39583f9829949655ff0c8d305502f.jpg\n2464c409a95ddb4fba3b8b35596e308c - Copy.jpg\nE4c35257edd963add8ed2809a5c01f48.jpg\n0f45d0662d0cd4acd32061b13907dbc2 - Copy.jpg\nB5ae07f03d2a4d708a525b94104960a9 - Copy.jpg\nC9180860b9cb5ff405c1737d6e260368.jpg\nThanh-pho-mo-uoc-trong-100-nam-toi.jpg\nFile:Cyberprep moodboard.png\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Visual]]\n[[Category:Written]]\n[[Category:Fashion]]\n[[Category:Electronic]]"}}}]}}}}
