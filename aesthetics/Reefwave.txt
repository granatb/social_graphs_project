Reefwave's primary colors are various shades of blue and green, ranging out to yellow or purple in some examples (though not both at once). Its imagery depicts coral reefs, sea life, aquariums and nature.   \n\nBecause much of Reefwave centers around the way light behaves, its aesthetics pop up often in video games, where refraction is a fairly common way to display the power of a game's graphics engine.    \n== Music ==\nMusic that could be considered \"Reefwave\" includes:\n\n* Deef's \"Nostalgia of an Ex-Gangsta-Rapper\" and \"Mhh Mh\"\n* Tipper's \"Dreamsters\" and \"Dreamsters VIP\"\n* KOAN Sound's \"Viridian Dream\", \"Jongmyo\" and \"The Zulla\" (possibly the best example of Reefwave music out there)\n*Lemon demon`s \"The ocean\"\n\n== Other media ==\nFilm that could be considered \"Reefwave\" includes:\n\n* Ponyo\n* Finding Nemo\n* some sections of Life of Pi\n* The Blue Planet\n\nGames that incorporate elements of Reefwave include:\n\n* Minecraft (with shaders specifically)\n* ABZU\n* Animal Crossing: New Horizons\n* Subnautica\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery widths=\"185\">\nABZU screenshot.jpg|thumb|[https://redd.it/63piph A screenshot from the game ABZU.]\nWoman with bananas.jpg|thumb|[https://redd.it/ayucf2 A woman with bananas floating around her.]\nJellyfish.jpg|thumb|[https://pinkkryptonite.tumblr.com/post/87379398367 In which the marinepunk aesthetic crosses with glowwave.]\nOffish.jpg|thumb|[https://redd.it/il201d Welcome to my offish.]\nRay.jpg|thumb|[https://www.pikist.com/free-photo-veibs A royalty-free photo of a ray.]\nMangroves.jpg|thumb|[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Inside_Pichavaram_Mangrove_Forest.jpg A mangrove forest doesn't exactly fit the reefwave aesthetic, but it has a very similar energy.]\nSEUS demo.png|A demonstration of the SEUS PTGI Minecraft shader pack.\nReef.png|From the music video of \"Pools,\" a song by the band Glass Animals.\nMy Post (5).png|Aesthetic Collage (Fashion Based)\nFile:Gradienthair.png|thumb|[https://theconfessionsofahairstylist.com/blog/2016/5/29/instagram-inspiration-roundup A woman's hair dyed in a blue through green gradient.]\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Needs work]]\n[[Category:Visual]]\n[[Category:Music]]\n[[Category:Wave Suffix]]\n[[Category:Oceans and islands]]"}}}]}}}}
