This is a page that will be part of a series on more anthropological approaches with interviews and noted influencers.'' \n\n'''Trailer Park Princess''' combines elements of [[Americana]], eroticism, poverty, horror, and femininity to create a feeling of nostalgia, unease, and deviancy. It incorporates many elements of [[Camp]] and Kitsch; it is a total subversion of what is deemed to be good taste in contemporary American society, as it openly celebrates identities that are shamed in American society: the poor, drag queens, sex workers and the kink scene, and rural \"uncultured\" communities. The users who post this content tend to come from an upbringing<ref>lovingrot (personal communication, April 15, 2021)\n[[File:Interview with Lovingrot.png|thumb]]\n<br /></ref> that is of this \"aesthetic,\" and the elements are personal and looked upon with fondness, rather than as a means of shock value and antagonization. \n\nAdditionally, the community contains many [[Nymphet|Nymphets]] and has strong overlap with the [[Morute]] community. Like many other [[2014-era tumblr|pre-suffix aesthetics]], the aesthetic is highly individualized and bloggers would typically combine or emphasize more on different aesthetics.  \n\n==Inspirations==\n\n===John Waters (Divine)===\n''This page is under construction''\n\n===Horror Movies from the 1980s===\n''This page is under construction''\n\n===Kinderwhore===\n''This page is under construction'' \n\n[[File:Tpp nicole.jpg|thumb|Nicole Dollanganger]]\n\n==Origins==\n\n===Nicole Dollanganger===\n''This page is under construction''\n\n===Lana Del Rey===\nLana Del Del's work often features trailer park imagery, themes, and aesthetics, particularly during the ''Lizzy Grant'' era.
