It mainly consisted of artistic and\u00a0philosophical young adults. They were known for listening to\u00a0jazz music, wore dark clothing, and were interested in French culture and literature.\u00a0\n\nThe main pastimes of the Pleiners were to hang out in the street, discuss art and literature, and visit underground\u00a0jazz clubs. In terms of style, they usually wore dark, irreverent clothes. Males often wore their hair combed forward while women kept their hair either very long or very short. The males occasionally smoked a pipes. Together with the\u00a0nozems, they were the first true youth culture in the Netherlands.\n\n== Visuals ==\n''Under Construction''\n\n== Fashion ==\n''Under Construction''\n\n== Music ==\n''Under Construction''\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery widths=\"130\">\nDownload-1591852419.jpg\nDownload (1)-1.jpg\nKuiven-dansen-op-straat.jpg\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Fashion]]\n[[Category:Visual]]\n[[Category:Dutch]]\n[[Category:Needs work]]"}}}]}}}}
