It was a countercultural, anti-consumerism youth movement and musical genre that defined Generation X. Grunge fashion was made popular by bands like Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Alice in Chains, and Soundgarden, and was meant to be timeless and quite casual.\n\n\n\nGrunge started in 1985 with Green River's album ''Come on Down'', but it did not become mainstream until the 1990s with Nirvana's ''Nevermind''. Grunge was most popular from roughly 1991 to 1997, and eventually lost its anti-consumerist philosophy. It can be argued that grunge began to decline in 1994, after the tragic suicide of Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain, though the genre maintained popularity until about 1997, when Soundgarden broke up and post-grunge bands like Creed became popular.\n\n==Visuals==\nA majority of Grunge's visuals involve a large amount of dirty, grimy imagery. These show a sort of hopelessness and disenchantment with modern society. A lot of earth tones and pale colors are used to convey this sort of cultural depression often associated with Grunge.\n\n==Fashion==\nGrunge fashion of the late 1980s and early-mid 1990s was often purchased out of thrift stores at the time. Some will argue it was done out of a rejection of the fashions of the time. It's generally agreed that it's because it was cheaper as, at the time, most grunge artists were dirt poor. As the fashion became more mainstream, editor of men's magazine Details James Truman was quoted in 1993, \"to me the thing about grunge is it's not anti-fashion, it's unfashion. Punk was anti-fashion. It made a statement. Grunge is about not making a statement, which is why it's crazy for it to become a fashion statement.\"\n\nMen often wore over-sized t-shirts, flannel shirts (that would be tied off around the waist when it got too hot), ripped jeans, and combat boots. These were considered timeless looks and were generally durable and reliable clothing to wear. Women tended to favor slip dresses, flannel shirts, ripped jeans, chokers, and the bell-bottoms/babydoll t-shirt was a popular combination as well. It went out of fashion after Kurt Cobain's suicide, but has started coming back into fashion in the 2010s and 2020s as '90s nostalgia began (an argument could be made this is what has led to the rise in prominence of [[Vaporwave]] as well). This trend began to regress as [[Y2K]] starts to become more and more prominent only to cycle back in another 20 years, as all trends seem to. But with the modern Grunge movement, the philosophical elements of the original Grunge movement were completely dropped in favor of just achieving the visual aesthetic of looking Grunge (although often paying far more exorbitant amounts of money compared to the original Grunge style icons, who almost exclusively shopped at Thrift Stores). \n\nFor more feminine, edgy fashion, however, there was also the [[Kinderwhore]] aesthetic, popularized by Courtney Love, who was Kurt Cobain's wife.\n\n==Music==\n[[File:Nirvana - Smells Like Teen Spirit (Official Music Video)|thumb|330x330px|The music video that started a revolution (and ended a LOT of careers.)]]\nWhile the fashion has certainly come back into style, the music doesn't seem to have the same comeback, which was a blend of heavy metal sound and punk rock ethos. However, after Kurt Cobain's suicide, grunge started to trail off into two separate genres: post-grunge, which included bands like Creed, Nickelback, Staind, Puddle of Mudd, Bush, and the Foo Fighters (fronted by former Nirvana drummer Dave Grohl) and [[Nu-Metal]], which included bands like KoRn, Limp Bizkit, Deftones, Kid Rock, Papa Roach, P.O.D., and Linkin Park. The Grunge revival has led to the old staples of the original grunge scene to see a return to popularity, but as of this writing, it has not led to any new grunge bands rising up the ranks, but not for lack of trying.

With noticeable gothic and [[Kawaii]] influences, the \"cute\" and deliberate soft grunge styles started to gain popularity in 2010, on social media. It is a modern take on the original grunge aesthetic, but adds in more colors and a feminine touch more modest than Kinderwhore.  \n\n*[https://www.pinterest.com/carrienicolestudio/pastel-goth-pastel-grunge/ Pastel Goth Pastel Grunge by Carrie]\n*[https://www.pinterest.com/deathofthenorm/pastel-grunge/ Pastel Grunge by Gwen]\n*[https://www.pinterest.com/neimykanani/soft-grunge/ Soft Grunge by N E I M Y]\n*[https://www.pinterest.com/bubblegumgraff/soft-grunge-soft-goth-and-90s-style/ \u262f\u271e Soft grunge, soft goth and 90s style \u271e\u262f by a collective]\n\n== Resources ==\nExternal links to help get a better understanding of this aesthetic.\n\n===Vendors===\n\n*[https://grungebygraves.com GRUNGEBYGRAVES]\n*[https://poshmark.com/closet/kjlthrifts KJThrifts]\n*[https://www.liveliky.com Liveliky]\n*[https://www.rebelsmarket.com Rebels Market]\n*[https://www.tillys.com Tillys]\n*[https://www.urbanoutfitters.com Urban Outfitters]\n*[https://www.vans.com Vans]\n\n===Playlists===\n\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DX11ghcIxjcjE?si=rYkjtTfATTKpkOnAq1jSgg Grunge Forever Official Spotify playlist]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0CC83jyXRwDHxO4B84YGA6?si=4833597b066748d8 Ultimate Grunge Playlist (A much more encompassing playlist with many more bands and songs)]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DWVwr24yj95lH?si=KdZGj621Sb6jE4ENZyGvgQ Post-Grunge Official Spotify playlist] (to see what became of the genre)\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1AHu1KznCUi9drUDx82Tq6?si=dQurRSs4RhCDeRKVO4IzTA 90's Grunge/Rock by prevypicklebear]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/118vZyUVFnaJkcPgxEkdd0?si=j0sZYJTNSJ2G5wnKJtWrMg Seattle Grunge by Iain C Forbes]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1AoXlYphhPLKxMzifkHoOk?si=gZMnOy8AQuy-zkStBVPckA grunge aesthetic songs by Kyra]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0z5wVsiX94vodFaCewcFyl?si=6Ot_uRY1QniETk770Lu1jw Grunge: Essentials by Cultura Inquieta]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2PNaFf1DInEl8NJSdkE4F4?si=iQnob5SERPyyrmf3119nHA The Sound of Grunge by The Sounds of Spotify]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6nB8xY9YgqldXEUWjLdp0v?si=387a11249eda4aeb \u26a0Warning\u26a0 by starrybrainss]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1Fn2VhhZEbvUG7iHQO33BB?si=dmj_icTVTNCqCbQNTjxkTA Intro to Grunge]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0LHxS0hC2RZI7px90TkxAL?si=Noeo4TLqSm6wnxNIl6GegA The Pulse of Grunge]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1kebihwSOacGYnV3jttt9l?si=y1NJr5y9Quey6nZxAEodkQ The Edge of Grunge]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4RCIiLvtrYHNoa6vWrgcc8?si=WkbGWYQ1SGe6RD7jNZCgPQ A \u2640Filter for Grunge]\n\n===Pinterest boards===\n*[https://www.pinterest.fr/nicolericcis/grunge-indie/ grunge // indie by nick.]\n*[https://www.pinterest.com/DaltonWayde/grunge/ Grunge by Dalton] \n*[https://www.pinterest.com/GrungeGirl25/90s-grunge-outfits/ 90s grunge outfits by Tessaaaaaa]\n*[https://www.pinterest.com/natalyanessa/grunge-90s-outfits/ Grunge 90s outfits by nat and leslhy]\n*[https://www.pinterest.com/hemcintyre0508/90s-grunge-outfits/ 90s grunge outfits by '''\u26a1\ufe0f'''Harper Mcintyre '''\u26a1\ufe0f''']\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" widths=\"135\" spacing=\"small\">\nTumblr pp4v95SBVH1wt28zko1 1280.jpg\n0ef8170075ee7f70532558b460f45bd1.jpg\nImages420.jpg\nGrunge fashion trend tips and tricks fashionisers.jpg\nImages69.jpg\nGrunge.jpg\nAlt fashion mens.jpg\nGrunge-2010.jpg\nGrunge-sweater.jpg\nGrunge-space-buns.jpg\nGrunge-skirt.jpg\nGrunge-pink.jpg\nGrunge-misfits.jpg\nGrunge-couple.jpg\nGrunge-beanie.jpg\nGrunbge-jacket.jpg\nFlannel.jpg\nFile:Smokes.jpg\nDirty-carousel.jpg\nSkater-faded.jpg\nPastel-grunge-bleachers.jpg\nPastel-grunge-window.jpg\nPastel-grunge-dress-bag.jpg\nPastel-grunge-graffiti.jpg\nGrunge-blue.jpg\nPastel-grunge-blue.jpg\n7665862.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n* \n\n[[Category:Music]]\n[[Category:Fashion]]\n[[Category:Visual]]"}}}]}}}}
