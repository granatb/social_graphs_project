With their long flowing hair and rich, though threadbare fabrics, bohemians stand out in a crowd representing a colorful counterculture based on creativity. Chunky jewelry isn't uncommon. If you are emulating the bohemian aesthetic, please be mindful that although some have become 'accessories,' certain forms of dress and jewelry belong to indigenous people, whose ancestral culture and deserve to be respected and not appropriated. An often overlooked misuse of culturally significant pieces would be mimicry of American Indian dreamcatchers. Please allow yourself to be humble as you educate yourself about common cultural appropriation behaviors. If you are not descended from such cultures, then it is offensive to claim any tradition as your own. \n\n=== Vendors ===\n\n*[https://thebohostyle.com Boho Style]\n\n== Room Style ==\nPopular house decor includes tapestries, lots of plants, macram\u00e9 plant holders, salt lamps, and any DIY projects; boho-chic embraces the 'here-and-now,' and so organization is not the primary concern of the bohemian style, instead in favor of observing the present and allowing yourself to leave things as they are when the next place calls you. \n\n== Music ==\n[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2SC1gOwMrFwK1renEAmwP6 boho chic - playlist by Danielle Youie]\n\n\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery widths=\"130\">\nImagesuuuuuuuuuuu.jpeg\nSkirt outfits.jpeg\nLIFESTYLE LIGHTROOM PRESETS Mobile and Desktop for Bloggers, Influencer, traveller, Instagram Filter.jpeg\nBoho Style Pants.jpeg\n28 Atuendos con inspiraci\u00f3n boho para dominar el oto\u00f1o con estilo.jpeg\nWhat to Pack Honeymoon Essentials.jpeg\nThe 10 best bohemian bloggers on Instagram you need to follow!.jpeg\nBohemian top.jpeg\nBohe tumblr.jpg\nBohe jewels.jpg\nNecklaces bohe.jpg\nHippie_bohe.jpg\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Fashion]]\n[[Category:Visual]]\n[[Category:Needs work]]"}}}]}}}}
