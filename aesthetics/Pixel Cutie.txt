Sometimes it can also associate with 8-bit clouds and sunsets, but not always. Pixel Cutie has a somewhat childish aspect.\n\n\n\n\n\n== Visual ==\nPixel Cutie is based on 8-bit art and digital art. There are usually fun, light, beautiful colors. Other pleasing art that fits this aesthetic can be clouds, sunsets, anime/chibi, animals, etc.  Unlike aesthetics such as [[Lo-Fi]] (which tend to promote a more chilled-out, laid-back vibe) or [[Milleniwave]] (which utilizes bright, happy colors to poorly mask existential dread), Pixel Cutie tends to go for more of a bouncy, fun, happy-go-lucky look that instills a sense of child-like glee.<br />\n\n== Fashion ==\nClothing that fits the Pixel Cutie aesthetic can include:\n\n* Brightly colored t-shirts\n* Tie-dye\n* Tees with fan-art from video games\n* Light colored jeans/jean shorts\n* Bright colored sneakers\n* Light-colored hair-ties, scrunchies, or bracelets on wrists\n* Anything related to art or gaming\n\nIn a lot of ways, Pixel Cutie fashion can cross into the sorts of fashions often associated with something like [[Vaporwave]] and [[Seapunk]] (although with less sarcasm and cynicism that is often associated with Vaporwave and less of an aquatic vibe that is often associated with Seapunk).\n\n== Media ==\n\n=== Music ===\nMusic that fits the Pixel Cutie aesthetic is usually 8-bit or synthesizer. It often doesn't have words.  Snail's House is a very popular example of an artist that makes music that (not specifically, more coincidentally) would fit this aesthetic.  Other popular genres can touch into Pixel Cutie territory include Vocaloid music, the more chiptune-y side of [[Synthwave]], Video Game music, and even some [[Hyperpop]].\n\nSome artists include:\n\n* Anamanaguchi\n*Moe Shop\n*Oresama\n* Reol\n*Shawn Wasabi\n*Snail's House\n*Studio Killers<br />\n\n=== Video Games ===\n\n* Undertale\n* Pokemon\n* Animal Crossing\n* Doki Doki Literature Club\n* Pony Island\n* Any old video game\n*Omori\n\n<br />\n== Cuisine ==\nSome drinks that fit the aesthetic:\n\n* Any sort of Lemonade\n* Any sort of juice\n* Boba/Bubble Tea\n* Seltzer \n* Cider\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\n\nFile:Pixel sylveon.png|pixel sylveon\nFile:Pixel sunset.png|a pixel sunset, involving oranges and purples and pinks\nFile:Henlo!.png|This is the same thumbnail as the Infobox, but with a slightly more saturated color pallate.\nFile:Judy.jpg|An Animal Crossing character, and it matches the Pixel Cuties color scheme\nFile:9k=Clouds.jpeg|clouds that fit the color scheme\n\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Feminine]]\n[[Category:Cute]]\n[[Category:Electronic]]\n[[Category:Youthful]]"}}}]}}}}
