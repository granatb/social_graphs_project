It features motifs related to horses like saddles, horseshoes and riding on horseback.\n\nAlthough equestrians are often ignorantly called \"Horse Girls\", the aesthetic of being an equestrian is very different. A \"Horse Girl\" is typically understood to be a young girl in a \"horse phase\" who acts like a horse, only talks about horses, and is generally crazy. An equestrian, on the other hand, can be a person of any gender who appreciates horses and the art of riding.\n\n\n\n== Visual ==\n[[File:Equestrian Aesthetic .jpg|thumb|235x235px]]\n\n* Riding Bareback\n\n* Horse Shows\n* Jumping\n* Dressage\n* Stables\n* Tack Rooms\n* Moments of Connection Between Horse and Rider\n\n''Popular Motifs Include:''\n\n* Horse Tack (bridles, saddles)\n* Bits (often in a pattern)\n* Stirrups (often in a pattern)\n* Horses (often close ups or silhouettes)\n* Riding Crops<br />\n\n== Fashion ==\nThe fashion consists mostly of traditional and modern English riding attire\n[[File:English Riding Fashion.jpg|thumb]]\n\n* Helmets\n* Jodhpurs\n* Tall Boots\n* Blazers\n* Short Gloves\n* Collared Shirts\n* Rat-Catchers\n* Polo Shirts\n* Belts\n\n''Note: Shirts are almost always tucked into the jodhpurs''\n\n<br />\n\n== Media ==\n\n=== Books ===\n\n* The Saddle Club series by Bonnie Bryant\n* Misty of Chincoteague and other horse books by Marguerite Henry\n*National Velvet by Enid Bagnold \n*The Scorpio Races by Maggie Stiefvater\n\n=== Movies ===\n\n*''Flicka'' (2006)\n*''Ride Like A Girl'' (2019)\n\n=== Music ===\n\n*All the Pretty Little Horses\n*Wild Horses by Natasha Bedingfield\n\n=== TV Shows ===\n\n* ''Free Rein'' (2017-2019)\n*''Heartland'' (2007-)\n* ''The Saddle Club'' (2001)\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery widths=\"135\">\nDa10084be3838aa83522f5e015b47dff.jpg\nE137c3e4f2f4b979ebe507e8e7f5b2b2.jpg\nD07e7309546ec63b5dfe12d797f22236.jpg\nF4a01950581355f42dc072a5110ea8b7.jpg\nC64f6b2d45cba8fd6025c284fd87475f.jpg\nC861bd408024bd9f733bab0dd9ddb73c.jpg\nDc62fc59ab1b0af6d34cd3c32a45c984.jpg\n7805392e42eb351feb4688dbb1b74a14.jpg\n31e2632823147dda768138c79d43a734.jpg\n586a8af79a8e9b41defee53aeb3358d9.jpg\nFf51873e3cde261a1e854593be4ab0d9.jpg\nAa3e3b9bc87e88febf255703b9ba16e9.jpg\nJsdbfjvbwhbfqhjrfe.jpg\nKrngkjwtngjnwtkgjnrwg.jpg\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Visual]]\n[[Category:Fashion]]"}}}]}}}}
