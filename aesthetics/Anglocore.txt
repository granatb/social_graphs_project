It has been seen as an expression of indigenous pride of the English people as any image perceived as inherently English falls under the Anglocore banner. It buys into the philosophy that the future of England rightfully belongs to the English people alone. \n\n==Visual==\nAnglocore visuals have a strong focus on the flag of St George and an overarching theme of English nationalism. Prominent colours include red and white, often alongside pink, purple or magenta hues. Images are often accompanied by patriotic quotes from figures such as William Shakespeare, Cecil Rhodes, Oswald Mosley and a variety of English monarchs and politicians. Anglocore may also focus on ideas of glory through classical architecture and war. \n\nWhile many Anglocore-esque images appear more wave-like, almost any image perceived as inherently English can be included under the Anglocore umbrella.\n\n==Music==\nAny music that provokes a sense of English patriotism, good examples include;\n*God Save the Queen\n*Land of Hope and Glory - Edward Elgar\n*Rule Britannia - Thomas Arne\n*Jerusalem\n*Roots - Show of Hands\nOther Anglocore music might just be music that feels or sounds English - giving off an Anglocore vibe. Some examples may be;\n*Baggy Trousers - Madness\n*Baba O'Riley - The Who\n*Fluorescent Adolescent - Arctic Monkeys\n*Wonderwall - Oasis\n*We will rock you - Queen\n*Our House - Madness\n\n'''Playlists''':\n\n* [https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1nPxaiDdYNsB54EzL44ljz?si=6792f36e2af44252 British/ Mod Spotify Playlist by albertlbaker]\n\n[[Category:Core Suffix]]"}}}]}}}}
