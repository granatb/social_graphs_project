It has a sleeker and shiny aesthetic compared to Dieselpunk, which has a tendency to be more gritty and dark aesthetic to it. Often times, Decopunk will use slightly more modern technology compared to the times it's supposed to evoke like VHS tapes.\u00a0 \n\n== Visual ==\nDecopunk shares a lot in common with Dieselpunk aesthetics, but with more of a focus on the Art Deco style that was popular around the time.  A perfect visual example of the Decopunk aesthetic would be the original ''BioShock'' video game.\n\n== Fashion ==\nA lot of Decopunk fashion does tend to draw upon Dieselpunk's similar influences, but there's definitely more of a focus on looking fashionable and classically presentable than there is on the grittiness one would find within the Dieselpunk genre. Definitely expect more zoot suits, dresses, and higher-end fashion in Decopunk circles than you would find within the Dieselpunk genre of aesthetics.\n\n== Music ==\n=== Spotify playlist ===\n* [https://open.spotify.com/user/r4u1k5sul5dz7kdexxb2bwpaz/playlist/3DuKMMGxVx27sGGAyPy2te DecoPunk playlist by Idris]\n* [https://open.spotify.com/user/dibleopard/playlist/6CgNrgYT337rc9q2GZ2mAt Decopunk playlist by dibleopard]\n* [https://open.spotify.com/user/bogartbearbreaker/playlist/4lH5n0BtluPAIhVsohY4GE Decopunk playlist by bogartbearbreaker]\n* [https://open.spotify.com/user/sketchytsh/playlist/1ITFMFdYP0kNsBlg3tiEUY decopunk bois playlist by sketchytsh]\n* [https://open.spotify.com/user/lark93/playlist/424e3PRG3Z8wISk2TZenen DecoPunk Ensemble playlist by lark93]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4Uc05VRJyuq6zydPRICPXA?si=7eb162fe9a964c8b Dieselpunk/Decopunk Crossover playlist by WattpadAmbassadors] \n\n== Subgenres ==\nThere are two schools of thought when it comes to Decopunk. These are Piecraftian and Ottensian.\n\n=== Piecraftian Decopunk ===\nPiecraftian Decopunk tends to focus on the aesthetics popular during World War I and World War II and usually focuses on how human culture would evolve in the face of constant widespread warfare.\u00a0This can cause Piecraftian Decopunk to bleed somewhat into [[Dieselpunk]] since the focus of Piecraftian Decopunk to be more on survival than aesthetic evolution.\u00a0Examples of Piecraftian Decopunk include movies like the original [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Max Mad Max] film, as well as George Orwell's [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteen_Eighty-Four 1984], [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfenstein:_The_New_Order Wolfenstein: The New Order], and the PS3 exclusive [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killzone Killzone].\n\n=== Ottensian Decopunk ===\nOttensian Decopunk is focused on the aesthetics and decadence of the Roaring Twenties. This leads to speculation on how it would evolve if it were completely uninterrupted by the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street_Crash_of_1929 1929 Market Crash (Black Tuesday)] that led to the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression Great Depression] or by either World War and generally has a more utopian vision of the future (similar to the relationship between [[Solarpunk]] and [[Cyberpunk]]) and is more of a version of [[Retro-Futurism]]. Examples of fiction that work into the Ottensian Decopunk label include [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rocketeer_(film) The Rocketeer], [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_Captain_and_the_World_of_Tomorrow Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow], and (retroactively), the works of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Asimov Isaac Asimov].\n\n=== The Outskirts ===\nOther works of fiction associated with Decopunk include the works of H.P. Lovecraft and noir fiction like Casablanca and LA Noire.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"135\">\nD.P(1)\nEmpirestate.jpg\n10477878 306894912832419 6866538769345261381 n.jpg|Welcome to the Decopunk Future\n</gallery>\n\n== In Media ==\n=== Animation ===\n* The Incredibles\n* Metropolis (2001)\n*Batman: The Animated Series\n\n=== Live Action ===\n\n* The Rocketeer (1991)\n* Dick Tracy (1990)\n\n=== Video Games ===\n* BioShock\n\n[[Category:Punk Suffix]]\n[[Category:Fashion]]\n[[Category:Visual]]\n[[Category:Written]]"}}}]}}}}
