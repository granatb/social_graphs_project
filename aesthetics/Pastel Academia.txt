It revolves around the ideals of having a passion for learning and studying, specifically the arts and literature. Someone who is a part of the Pastel Academia aesthetic is less mature and more child-like than those who identify with the other versions of academia. They enjoy venturing and have an overall upbeat and positive outlook on life, juxtaposing its less optimistic variations. Unlike its more well-known variations, Pastel Academia visually stems from a mixture of East Asian (mainly Japanese) and European cultures.\n\n== About==\n'''Pastel Academia''' is another variation of the 'Academia' aesthetic. What makes Pastel Academia different from other Academia aesthetics is that it is very clear and easily identifiable. Pastel Academia focuses on having a passion for learning, exploring, and studying. Like other academias, Pastel Academia is about finding romanticism in education and learning new things. Unlike the more popular variation, [[Dark Academia]], people who identify with Pastel Academia are more life-loving. They find happiness and peace in the little things like hanging out with a small group of friends or going to small caf\u00e9s early in the morning, similar to people identifying with [[Light Academia]]. What makes them stand out the most, though, is their child-like and more immature personality than other variants. They are optimistic, hopelessly romantic, curiosity-driven, young-at-heart individuals. This is not to be associated with them infantilizing themselves (to be discussed later in more detail). Pastel Academia stands out when compared to other academia personalities(the elephant in the room, if you will). <br />[[File:Arcitecture.jpg|thumb]]\n\n== Visual==\nPastel Academia visuals are heavily inspired by European and Japanese or East Asian cultures and the environment. For example, the architecture of European-style buildings, specifically universities like Oxford and places like Alnwick Castle, along with countryside and outskirt environments of Japanese provinces such as Chichibu, Shirakaba, and many more. However, if you live somewhere where there isn't much to explore, you're still encouraged to go out and explore places. Look for secret gems in the urban city and create your own homely Pastel Academia environment.     \n\n=== Studying ===\nCute caf\u00e9s and secret studying spots are also a huge part of Pastel Academia. Having a cozy space to study in and having cute supplies - like washi tape and personalized notebooks - are also part of Pastel Academia. Cute supplies are just supplies that are supposed to help people study more; this means that they don't have to be expensive. Pastel Academia isn't limited to people who can afford expensive school supplies.\n\n===Hobbies===\nWhen they are procrastinating on their studies, pastel academics enjoy partaking in creative hobbies which help them calm down or play the role as a beacon of productivity and calmness. This can include journaling, painting, drawing, biking, knitting, crochet, playing an instrument, cooking, watching series and movies,editing, photography, and much  more.\n\n== Media ==\nThe following medias have some kind of relation to the pastel academia aesthetic, namely in visuality. If you don't enjoy many of these that does not exclude from the subculture by any means, be at peace and comfort with what you enjoy <3 \n\n===Movies===\n\n* Ponyo\n* My Neighbor Totoro\n* Kikki's Delivery Service\n* Only Yesterday\n* The Garden Of Words\n* Hal\n* Whisper Of The Heart\n* Your Name\n* The Secret World Of Arrietty\n* Tamako Love Story\n* Sumikko Gurashi The Movie: The Unexpected Picture Book and the Secret Child\n*''L'\u00e9tranger de la Plage''\n* Cinnamoroll: The Movie\n\n===TV Shows===\n====anime====\n* Fairy Tail\n* Hanayamata\n* Sailor Moon\n* Cardcaptor Sakura\n* K-On!\n* Quintessential Quintuplets\n* Love Live: School Idol Project\n* Kinmoza\n* Is The Order A Rabbit?\n*Smile Precure\n*Hyouka\n*Ouran High School Host Club\n*Kaichou Wa Maid-sama\n*Teasing Master Takagi-san\n*Acchi Kocchi\n*Yuyushiki\n*Lucky Star\n*Mewkledreamy\n*Koisuru Asteroid\n*Fruits Basket\n*Machikado Mazoku\n*Hitoribocchi no OO Seikatsu\n*Saint Tail\n*Hugtto Precure\n*Comic Girls\n*Rilu Rilu Fairilu\n*Lady Jewelpet\n*Slow Start\n*Gakuen Babysitters\n*Nyanko Days\n*Non Non Biyori\n*Chi's Sweet Home\n*Shugo Chara!\n*Sansha Sanyou\n*Mirmo Zibang\n*ToraDora!\n*Pri Para\n*Yumeiro Pattisiere\n*Momokuri\n*Hello Kitty Paradise\n*Yuru Yuri\n*Hanamaru Youchien\n*Mitsuboshi Colors\n*Wakaba Girl\n*Tokyo Mew Mew\n*Onegai My Melody\n*Rilakkuma TO Kaoru\n*Urawa no Usagi-chan\n*Maple Twon Monogatari\n*Ore Monogatari!!\n*Pita Ten\n*Gakuen Utopia Manabi Straight!\n*Kofuku Graffiti\n*Kamisama Hajimemashita\n*Tamako Market\n*Jewelpet Happiness\n*Hidamari Sketch\n*Ojamajo Doremi\n*Hinako Note\n*Kaguya-sama: love is war\n*Nekopara\n\n====Cartoons====\n*Angelina Ballerina\n*Molang\n*Hello Kitty Super Cute Adventures\n*We Bare Bears\n*Summer Camp Island\n\n==== Shows and movies with sensitive content ====\n*Puella Magi Madoka Magica\n*K-12 \n*Scream Queens\n*Gakko Gurashi\n*Girl From Nowhere\n*Princess Tutu\n*Mahou Shoujo Site\n\n====Dramas====\n*Love Alarm\n*Girl's World\n\n===Games/Apps===\n\n====Mobile:====\n*Pastel Girl : Dress Up Game\n*Neko Atsume\n*LINE:Disney Tsum Tsum\n*SUMI SUMI : Matching Puzzle\n*Rilakkuma Farm\n*Momo's Dressup\n*Sumikkogurashi Farm\n*Peter Rabbit -Hidden World-\n*Rakko Ukabe - Let's call cute sea otters!\n*Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp\n*Love Nikki-Dress UP Queen\n*Genshin Impact\n*SKY\n\n====Nintendo:====\n*Animal Crossing: New Horizons\n*Pok\u00e9mon\n*Ouchi De Rilakkuma -Rilakkuma Ga Ouchi Ni Yattekita \u2013 Nintendo Switch Japan\n\n====Xbox====\n*Calico\n\n===Books and Manga===\n==== Books ====\n*anne of green gables\n*Little Women\n*Little Princess\n*The Secret Garden\n*Daddy Long-Legs\n*Winnie the Pooh\n*The Secrets of Divine Love\n\n==== Manga ====\n*Hatsukoi*Rail Trip\n*CLAMP No Kiseki\n*Kirari Books Meisouchu!\n*Fushigi Neko No Kyuu-chan\n*KiraKira\u2605Study ~Zettai Goukaku Sengen~\n*The Life After Retirement of Magical Girls\n*Kitchen Princess\n*Nanatsu Boshi Tea Time\n*Kilala Princess\n*Pixie Pop\n*Bocchi the Rock\n*Tsuki Ga Kirei Desu Ne\n\n=== Webtoons ===\n*Odd Girl Out\n*Cat Loaf Adventures\n*True Beauty\n*HEART Anthology\n*Cursed Princess Club\n*Your Smile is a Trap\n*Saphie The One-Eyed Cat\n*My Kitty And Old Dog\n*The Kiss Bet\n*Choco Latte\n*Aerial Magic\n*Smile Brush\n*Small World\n*Strawberry Seafoam\n*All That We Hope To Be\n\n=== Videos that could fit this aesthetic ===\n==== Music Videos ====\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQsZvea6zFk -Tapioca Milk Tea music video by Wasuta]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFUHS1Ei7qw -To Heart music video by Fromis_9]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7qisJ_KuYI -Ah-Choo music video by Lovelyz]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GU7icQFVzHo -Glass Bead music video by Gfriend]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2TtQYuFfWw -Glass Shoes music video by Fromis_9]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Se8bbsUFjC8 -Navillera music video by Gfriend]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzEZFGOiR58 -Triangle Dreamer music video by Niji no Conquistador]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYM508YPWW0 -WELCOME TO DREAM music video by wasuta for the anime \"idol time pripara\"]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIN5_tJRiyY -Secret Garden music video by Oh My Girl]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VKcLPdY9lI -Rough music video by Gfriend]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAobKr_9bIQ -Lisent To My World concert video by Oh My Girl]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGdazWCfJ5Y -Conversation Fancy music video by Kamiyado]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ov3MT0vdI9c -Cupid music video by Oh My Girl]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3KuJqe3Epg -PITAPAT (DKDK) music video by Fromis_9]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYHyAIFG3iI -Me Gustas Tu music video by Gfriend]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0p1bmr0EmE -What is Love?

There is no need to conform to these ideas; they are just some of many possibilities.[[File:Pastel Academia clothes example.jpg|thumb|An example of Pastel Academia-style clothes.]]\n\n*[[File:Pastel Academia clothes example 2.jpg|thumb|A second example of Pastel Academia-style clothes.]]\n\n===Clothes===\n[[File:45d8add36555717256702d417d855191.jpg|thumb|A simpler/casual pastel academia outfit.]]\n\n*Vests, especially sweater vests\n*Plaid designs and patterns\n*Trousers\n*Skirts\n*White [[Lolita]]-style dresses\n*Collared shirts\n*Pastel or floral Hijabs\n*Sweaters\n*Knitwear\n*Turtlenecks\n*Seifuku dresses and uniform\n*Long net skirts\n*Lolita-style shoes\n\n===Accessories===\n\n*Bow ties\n*Neckties\n*Schoolbags\n*Berets\n*Hairclips\n*Hair bows\n*Watches\n*Bracelets\n*Friendship charms\n*Lace socks\n\n[[File:Pastel Academia hair.jpg|thumb|An example of Pastel Academia-style hair.]]\n\n===Hair===\n\n*Pigtails\n*Two ponytails\n*Hair Down with an accessory\n*Braid(s)\n*Half-up, half-down twin-tails\n*Puff Balls (for natural hair)\n\n===Makeup===\nThis is not a necessity if you don't prefer makeup.

Slice of life anime is an excellent example of a genre that usually presents pastel academia ideals and values. TV shows and movies like Scream Queens and The Grand Budapest Hotel represent Pastel Academia as well, though from a more visual perspective. Again, you do not need to like or enjoy every single movie, TV show, anime, or piece of music that is mentioned. As long as you can appreciate and like the visuals of Pastel Academia as well as the values this subculture has to offer, you're good to go.<br />\n\n===Music===\nPastel Academia-style music involves lots of girl/boy bands, Lo-Fi, soft ballads, soft pop, and musical soundtracks from childhood movies. Pastel Academia is an inclusive subculture where academics don't or shouldn't care about what language the music they listen to is in, as long as it sounds okay.\n\n====Artists====\n\n*[https://open.spotify.com/artist/2uYWxilOVlUdk4oV9DvwqK?si=ajdBvhtjR8-_N3rTsUigBw Mitski]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/artist/00FQb4jTyendYWaN8pK0wa?si=FTmLV6yKSquSEIOwETJZUA Lana Del Rey]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2XGTc6QgsZOQBiX4miH5Ka Melanie Martinez]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/artist/163tK9Wjr9P9DmM0AVK7lm?si=9c50rw2NTCGQlA5AviVslw Lorde]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/artist/3dTzeO0QCd86cXSgQ04Y3r?si=iibYgUYtSCKVt1cYbs7ZrQ Rainych]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/artist/4k5fFEYgkWYrYvtOK3zVBl?si=G8y2unEXQwq5lIessknh3Q BOL4]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/artist/1lFLniFTaPjYCtQZvDXpqu?si=Np3cC30_Sj6MBCPOHus1Jw Sejeong]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/artist/6OwKE9Ez6ALxpTaKcT5ayv?si=P6Bi8OjwTumxxM7IkvG4pQ AKMU]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/artist/6gWGD0yeQYobb2sq0LUr7k?si=k7q1H5yZSCCEkhzD-2xMtg L.Dre]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/artist/5dCvSnVduaFleCnyy98JMo?si=LfvxUe2VRUOch2MG7GlKow HEIZE]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/artist/3dz0NnIZhtKKeXZxLOxCam?si=nq8wnQ5eR--FEsF02L-Psg Porter Robinson]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/artist/07QEuhtrNmmZ0zEcqE9SF6?si=HyfjcTzuQMKdygeeztILQw Owl City]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/artist/21TinSsF5ytwsfdyz5VSVS?si=TkNSnkqdT9ipyXBMuE05Rg Dodie]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/artist/0lhcAgqzhRZuhHTXJsilSc?si=vQO09GnnSZ-Ing_wvq3tow Chevy]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/artist/29O9ZebFa65aIEvMaW5pQY?si=PlznYU0dSv-Ew_RzcFSACA Snail's House]\n\n<br />\n== Notes==\nThe two main aspects in almost every aesthetic is the '''ideals, personality and the visuals.'''\n\n===The Ideals & Personality ===\n<br />\n\n#'''Clearing Up Misconceptions'''\n\nThere could be controversy in the future about this aesthetic being too \"childish\" to the point where people label it as infantilising. In no way shape or form is the intention of this aesthetic to attract or entertain pedophiles or imitate children. There is a huge difference between enjoying what society labels as 'childish' things and infantilising yourself to entertain adults. Pastel Academia stands for people who never or rarely got to experience being young, even if it's a time in their life they miss. Whether it's part of their personality or something that was developed throughout their life due to their environment, the innocence of this aesthetic is solely to give those people a safe space where they can express their love for studying arts, literature, and much more while standing up to people who tell them to \"act their age\" just because they are passionate about certain things like going on picnics, pastel colours and collecting things that make them happy. There is no place in this community for individuals who infantilize themselves for the pleasure of pedophiles, incels, and others.\n\n#'''Respect & Inclusivity'''\n\nThe Pastel Academia subculture is inclusive of people from all walks of life. Any race, gender, sexuality, and spirituality are welcomed here. People who marginalise and discriminate against other people are not welcomed in this subculture by any means. <u>Respect is the number one ideology of this subculture.</u> We do not associate with people who claim to be of this subculture but chose to harm and inflict any kind of disrespect onto others for any reason. We aren't immature in the sense that we act like children, but in our interests and hobbies. \n\n#'''Personality'''\n\n* As mentioned before, the Pastel Academia aesthetic focuses on people who are more child-like at heart. They are usually optimists whose strength is that they often think creatively and outside of the box. This makes them academically suited for studies like literature and the arts. However, they don't have to be confined to just those subjects in particular.\n*They love giving and occasionally craft gifts for their loved ones. In a relationship, they are caring and loving toward the other person/people.\n*They are also quite spiritual despite their child-like tendencies. They are always searching for meanings to things due to their curiosity through religion or any other practice. This also drives them to philosophy.\n\n== Resources ==\nExternal links to help get a better understanding of this aesthetic.\n\n===Vendors ===\n\n*[https://deerdoll.com/ Deer Doll]\n*[https://www.aliexpress.com/store/1762773?spm=a2g0o.detail.100005.1.ccce15290LylYY Alyaboomty Store]\n*[https://www.juwas.com/ Juwas Fashion]\n*[https://nothinbasichere.com/ Nothin Basic Here]\n*[https://www.youvimi.com/ youvimi]\n*[https://www.yihfoo.com/ yihfoo store]\n\n===Playlists===\n\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7DOWk825hMtsex67X3ikK3?si=7YwCcbazQj-k8eZrzmllgQ Pastel Academia Spotify playlist by \u8d70\u308b \u30aa\u30de\u30de]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/user/uvhx29tgflzzo2p7ej2i8ncvz/playlist/1D3vMFevLPQqyoLZ7jjGT5?si=3faAVLymSfCB6PLOIAJf5A Pastel Academia Spotify playlist by MagicalGirl]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/user/j.rascu/playlist/7wbs2FZzeRN85JnJND2Lgw?si=weOW4iwFTr6YQFYX4-qRxg Pastel Academia Spotify playlist by j.rascu]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/user/oykmnxfucikhogvjee32wu9rl/playlist/0KokLehN5wg4UoXEZVnnik?si=8tmugc3mSqy2u8jCddeLbg pastel academia Spotify playlist by cheryl!!]\n\n===Pinterest Boards ===\n\n*[https://www.pinterest.com/princessomama/pastel-academia/ pastel academia by Run]\n*[https://www.pinterest.com/Sosocal0404/pastel-academia/ Pastel Academia by Sophia Cali]\n*[https://www.pinterest.com/victorysunshine/pastel-academia/ Pastel Academia by Victory Sunshine]\n*[https://www.pinterest.com/winterbun_096/pastel-academia/ Pastel Academia by winterbun_096]\n*[https://www.pinterest.com.mx/diegopinkberry/pastel-academia-aesthetic/ Pastel Academia by Diego pinkberry]\n*[https://www.pinterest.com.mx/lovesotries/springcorepastel-academia/ springcore/pastel academia by Felice!]\n*[https://www.pinterest.com.mx/gxmasservvi/pastel-academia/ pastel academia  by meh]\n*[https://br.pinterest.com/silverz_/aesthetic/pastel-academia/ Aesthetic \u2666\ufe0e Pastel Academia \u2666\ufe0e by Silverz]\n*[https://pin.it/8ID22yQ Pastel Academia by KumanekoBaby]\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery widths=\"130\" bordercolor=\"#FFB7B2\">\n1e25fad6acd076a35e9aaa406b62b16f.jpg\nPastel Academia clothes example 2.jpg\nPastel Academia clothes example.jpg\nPastel Academia hair.jpg\nD419fb771a58a519c6fb96523f9ee1d8.jpg|clothes idea\nFfc732f3c466f4f701c90590e451c752.jpg|clothes idea\nA6a9d4617371e1ec30aa9e5ea7db1c40.jpg|Hair idea\n65d268bb64c476cbb641e33104110619.jpg|pastel academia shoes\n28a779e1d525b860e1f6c4f079493799.jpg|Hair idea\nPastel aca architecture .jpg\nJournaling.jpg\nArcitecture.jpg\n45d8add36555717256702d417d855191.jpg\nPastelacademia.jpg\nPastel academia food.jpg\nPastel Soft Colour Palette.png\nPastel academia colors.png\nWe all need these skills.jpg\nEeeeeeeee.jpg\nReally cute outfit.jpg\nLarme.jpg\nThis is what i want.jpg\nYou need this.jpg\nUgh i want to live this life so bad.jpg\nI love this.jpg\nOmfg i need this life.jpg\nPastel academia is my dream.jpg\nAAAAAAAAAAAAA.jpg\nVuyfJL7R69UY6tib7t7TIYFKUYR.jpg\nDang this is amazing.jpg\nFrick omfg.jpg\nGood outfit that i want.jpg\nC4c8060af69505ffcfb58ec54abce5d8.jpg\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Academia]]\n[[Category:Visual]]\n[[Category:Fashion]]\n[[Category:Written]]\n[[Category:Music]]\n[[Category:Created Aesthetic]]\n[[Category:Feminine]]\n[[Category:Cute]]\n[[Category:Youthful]]"}}}]}}}}
