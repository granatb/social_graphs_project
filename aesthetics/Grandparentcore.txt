It is a comfortable, whimsical (but not necessarily chaotic) and comfortable aesthetic centered around focusing on things we enjoy most. Though it may appear simple or even naive at first glance, grandparentcore implies a certain level of expert knowledge in various topics or activities. Most of the things that are involved with grandparentcore are old, vintage, or even antique as it is implied that they have been used or were invented a long time ago. This aesthetic is split into two different aesthetics: Grandmacore and Grandpacore. Though these two groups fall very neatly into binary gender categories, they tend to overlap or borrow from each other. They aren't Female-Grandparentcore and Male-grandparentcore; they are two groups under one overarching umbrella.\n\n==Grandmacore==\n{{Aesthetic|title1 = Grandmacore|image1 = knitting grandma sweater.jpg|related_aesthetics = [[Bloomcore]]<br>[[Cottagecore]]<br>[[Craftcore]]<br>[[Foodie]]|key_motifs = kindness, baking, knitting/crocheting, embroidery/sewing|caption1=Grandma knitting.|key_colours=varies on individual|key_values=kindness\n\nlove of kitsch\n\nhoning expertise\n\ncomfort\n\ncosiness\n\naltruism\n\nwisdom\n\nenjoying favorite activities|related_media=Agatha Christie Novels \nRadio Dramas \nMurder, She Wrote (1984-96) \nCozy Mysteries \nGame Shows \nThe Golden Girls (1985-92) \nSteel Magnolias  (1989) \nKnives Out (2019) \nSherlock Holmes Stories}}\n\n'''Grandmacore''' refers to an aesthetic that is based around cottage and stereotypical grandma related things ie. gardening, soft knitted fabric, crocheting, farmland animals, fresh baked bread,\u00a0etc.\n\n===Visuals===\n\n* Knitting and balls of yarn in baskets\n* Lots of baked goods and sweets\n* Probably a rocking or armchair in the corner by a fireplace\n*Doilies\n*Old novelty teapots, plates, or vases\n*Fake floral arrangements\n*Brightly colored old furniture (sometimes covered in plastic)\n*Kitschy trinkets or novelty items centering on a theme unique to the individual (cats, lighthouses, flowers, etc.)\n*House organized in a very particular way\n\n===Fashion===\n\n*Cozy jumpers (hand-knitted)\n*Old dresses (hand-made)\n*Knitted cardigans (hand-knitted)\n*Aprons\n*Long skirts\n*Slippers\n*White hair pulled back neatly\n*Older jewelry such as brooches, matching sets, old rings\n*Faded bathrobes\n*Long cotton or flannel nightgowns\n* [https://cottagecore-aesthetic.com/ This fashion website]\n\n=== Activities ===\n\n* Knitting\n* Crocheting\n* Quilting\n* Sewing\n* Baking\n* Doing puzzles (crossword, picture, wordsearch, etc.)\n* Cooking\n* Gift-giving for loved ones\n* Watching daytime TV (Game Shows, Soap Operas, Talk Shows)\n* Listening to the radio or records (or even Podcasts, National Public Radio or similar, etc.)\n* Gardening\n* Floral arranging\n* Walking early in the morning with friends\n* Going to bed early\n\n===Music===\n\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0w0XnSOdSEKl5Agm0zc0ff?si=3mHV6NIaSdmoLWhSjzThWA grandmacore\ud83c\udf44\ud83c\udf3f\u2728 Spotify playlist by kirsten]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6UEjS3TcGl3QySTlVsRAeJ?si=92tsHwNqROeiykHjzBX5uA grandmacore Spotify playlist by Ema Strako\u0161ov\u00e1]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1sLkJcUZJ56EYiMHTqm7cl?si=HczZ_l-1Q7W5b2VQcaKoJg grandmacore Spotify playlist by vicky.mcgrath33]\n\n===Gallery===\n<gallery>\n\nFile:Grandmashouse.jpg\nFile:Grandma 2.jpg\nFile:Ceramics.jpg\nFile:Missmarple.jpg\n\n</gallery>\n\n==Grandpacore==\n{{Aesthetic|title1=Grandpacore|image1=Grandpa-in-chair.jpg|caption1=|other_names=|decade_of_origin=|creator/s=|key_motifs=Grouchiness, tinkering, vintage knick-knacks, clutter|key_colours=Neutrals|key_values=Quiet, sitting in a favorite chair, explaining vintage hobbies, televised sport games|related_aesthetics=|related_media=|related_brands=}}Grandpacore is related socially-accepted and more wholesome associations of stereotypical grandpas.
