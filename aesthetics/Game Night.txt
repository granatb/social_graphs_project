Game Night would be exemplified by any form of traditional games. Examples being D&D, Chess, WH40K, Monopoly, Battleship, Uno, Pathfinder and others. Communities have been created around game nights, and multiple clubs have been created in college campuses, bookstores or libraries, and cafes.\n\nPlaying board or tabletop games is also considered a nerdy, and is often coupled with lighthearted memes and jokes about people who participate in this sort of activity.\n\n== Visual ==\n* Board games\n* Dice\n* Cards\n* Game parts\n* Groups of people\n\n== Activities ==\n* Playing board games\n* Eating snacks and junk food\n* Drinking soda/alcohol/other sugary drinks\n* Arguing over who goes first\n* Arguing over who gets the last slice of pizza\n\n== Common Games ==\n\n=== Cooperative ===\n* Pandemic\n* Forbidden Island\n* Arkham Horror\n* Five Minute Dungeon\n\n=== Competitive ===\n* Munchkin\n* Monopoly\n* Battleship\n* Mancala\n* Apples to Apples\n* Uno\n* Dots and Boxes\n* King of Tokyo\n* Hares and Hounds\n* Hanafuda\n* Smash Up\n* Scrabble\n* Cuban Dominoes\n* Chess\n* Yu-Gi-Oh!
