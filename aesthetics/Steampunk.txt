Steampunk fiction often explores the anachronistic idea of what would have happened if society built upon steam as a primary energy source and maintained the [[Victorian]] visual style.\n\n== Visual ==\nSteampunk engineering often includes visible gears and screws, as well as analog clocks, steam-powered machines (including vehicles such as airships that often carry flying wooden ships), rotating propellers and dials. Those are always made of metals, wood, or even glass, but never plastics or other modern materials.   \n\n== Fashion ==\nSteampunk fashion often includes Victorian-style clothing, such as suits, waistcoats, top hats and long dresses. Lace, leather and brass are common materials. Accessories are also important to steampunk; popular ones include brass/copper jewelry, pocket watches, and goggles. Popular motifs include cogs, clocks, and sea creatures (particularly octopodes). Steampunk is popular in cosplay, but it can also be expressed more casually.[https://jazzymimi.wordpress.com/2011/08/21/the-casual-steampunk-for-him-or-her/][https://www.rebelsmarket.com/blog/posts/casual-steampunk-looks-you-can-wear-to-the-office]\n\n== Written ==\nA lot of Steampunk is, much like its futuristic counterpart [[Cyberpunk]], rooted in literary traditions, especially among the works of Jules Verne and H.G. Wells.  While it doesn't exactly share the nihilistic worldview often seen in Cyberpunk (opting instead for a more romantic worldview), it does share the rebellious spirit Cyberpunk has instilled in its aesthetic DNA, often used as a critique of the Victorian social etiquette that was popular in the time period by deconstructing or outright challenging the notions head-on.\n\n==Media==\n\n===Books===\n\n*Anything by Gail Carriger\n\n===Film===\n\n* A Series of Unfortunate Events\n*April and the Extraordinary World (2015)\n*Around the World in 80 Days\n*Hugo\n*Jingle Jangle (2020)\n*League of Extraordinary Gentlemen\n*Les aventures extraordinaires d'Ad\u00e8le Blanc-Sec (2010)\n*Oz the Great and Powerful\n*Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children\n*The City of Lost Children\n*The Golden Compass\n*Van Helsing\n*Vidocq\n*Wild Wild West\n*9 (2009)\n\n===TV Shows===\n*Carnival Row\n*The Nevers\n*Murdoch Mysteries\n*Arcane\n\n===Anime, Manga, & Comics===\n\n*Howl's Moving Castle\n*Vanitas no Carte (The Case Study of Vanitas)\n*Last Exile\n*Hollow Fields\n*Princess Principal\n\n=== Games ===\n\n* Professor Layton \n*Alice: Madness Returns\n*Killingfloor 1 and 2\n*Steamworld (series)\n\n=== Music ===\n\n* Steam Powered Giraffe\n*The Cog is Dead\n\n==Sub-Genres==\n\n===Teslapunk===\n'''Teslapunk''' is a subgenre of speculative fiction which is similar to steampunk, named for scientist and inventor Nikola Tesla, and refers to fictional narratives or visual styles inspired by 18th, 19th, and early 20th century pioneers of electricity and electrical devices.\n\nThis narrative or style commonly imagines an alternate history where widely available cheap (or free), clean, and often highly portable electrical energy replaces all previous energy sources (such as wood, coal and oil, and the steam engines that were fuelled by them), but has yet to be replaced (or is never replaced) by other energy sources itself (such as diesel or nuclear power).\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery orientation=\"none\" widths=\"130\">\n68bffce15145ba6ea21de94e6269d1ce.jpg\nSteampunk Mechanic by aternox.jpg\nTumblr pgx24vFnMa1qz71z8o1 r4 500.jpg|A general groundrule of where to draw inspiration for your Steampunk work of art.\nSteampunk artwork 1.jpg\nSteampunk artwork 2.jpg\nSteampunk artwork 3.jpg\nSteampunk artwork 4.jpg\nSteampunk artwork 5.jpg\nSteampunk artwork 6.jpg\nSteampunk artwork 8.jpg\nSteampunk artwork 10.jpg\nSteampunk artwork 12.jpg\nSteampunk artwork 16.jpg\nSteampunk artwork 17.jpg\nSteampunk artwork 19.jpg\nSteampunk artwork 20.jpg\nSteampunk artwork 21.jpg\nSteampunk artwork 22.jpg\nSteampunk artwork 23.jpg\nSteampunk artwork 24.jpg\nSteampunk artwork 25.jpg\nSteampunk artwork 26.jpg\nSteampunk artwork 27.jpg\nSteampunk artwork 28.jpg\nSteampunk artwork 29.jpg\nSteampunk artwork 30.jpg\nSteampunk artwork 31.jpg\nSteampunk artwork 32.jpg\nSteampunk artwork 33.jpg\nSteampunk artwork 34.jpg\nSteampunk artwork 35.jpg\nSteampunk artwork 37.jpg\nSteampunk artwork 38.jpg\nSteampunk artwork 39.jpg\nSteampunk artwork 40.jpg\nSteampunk artwork 41.jpg\nSteampunk artwork 42.jpg\nSteampunk artwork 43.jpg\nSteampunk artwork 44.jpg\nSteampunk artwork 45.jpg\nSteampunk artwork 46.jpg\nSteampunk artwork 47.jpg\nT-Punk.jpeg\nSteampunk alice.jpg\nAlice steampunk clock.jpg\nFile:Steamland killingfloor.jpeg\n</gallery>\n\n[[Category:Punk Suffix]]\n[[Category:Visual]]\n[[Category:Fashion]]\n[[Category:Music]]\n[[Category:Written]]\n[[Category:Recognized Community]]\n[[Category:Needs work]]"}}}]}}}}
