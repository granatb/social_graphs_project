They are famous for being loud, rude and refusing to take part in the strict manners of Japanese society.\n\nThis subculture flourished in Japan in the '80s and '90s. Yankii could be recognized by punch perms or pompadours, shaved eyebrows, altered\u00a0school uniforms, popping squats, being poor students and causing violence or trouble.\u00a0\u00a0Yankii\u00a0is a term that applies to both boys and girls. Although it is rumored that yankii would be recruited into the\u00a0''yakuza'' (the Japanese mafia), this is not always true. Many yankii simply joined the regular workforce and lived regular, productive lives after high school.\n\nThe name \"yankii\"\u00a0(\u30e4\u30f3\u30ad\u30fc) is borrowed from the English word \"Yankee\", a name taken from the American GIs who gave the Japanese their first glimpse into the world of rock \u2018n\u2019 roll.<ref>https://www.japantimes.co.jp/life/2002/07/05/language/our-yankii-are-different-from-your-yankees/</ref>\n\n== Fashion ==\n* Altered school uniforms\n** This includes making school uniforms look excessively oversized.\n* Dyed hair - red and blonde are popular.\n* If associated with [[Bosozoku]] gangs: long jackets with kanji that represent their group name and motto.\n* Pompadour\n* Miniskirts (women)\n* Shaved eyebrows\n\n== Lifestyle ==\nYankii tend to be part of a tight-knit community that was created during middle school and stayed together through adulthood.\n\nSome stereotypes (throughout the late 1980s and early 1990s) included men entering the field of construction, while women were teen mothers who dropped out of highschool.\n\nYankii also maintain a strict social code with specific customs.
