Most items in an emanicicore wardrobe should eschew \"fast fashion.\" They should be fairly sourced, made to last, and ideally possible to repair. Here are some notable shops for emancicore wear:\n\n*[https://www.shiborilondon.co.uk/ Shibori London] \u2012 UK shop that works with Indian artisans to make emanicore in support fair trade and right livelihood\n*[https://www.marmadukelondon.com/ Marmaduke London] \u2012 UK shop that revitalizes local wool production through cottage production of emancicore\n*[https://sirplus.co.uk/ Sir Plus] \u2012 UK shop that makes upcycles surplus into functional and timeless garments\n*[https://www.devi-clothing.com/ Devi Clothing] \u2012 Luxembourg artisan selling upcycled clothing, some made from vintage Pashminas by [https://saheliwomen.com Saheli Women]\n*[https://www.maybecollection.com/ Maybe Collection] \u2012 Baton Rouge, Louisiana (USA), shop selling affordable, sustainably made-to-order garments for women using strictly natural linens\n*[https://www.etsy.com/shop/LigaTreija Liga Treija] \u2012 Latvian shop that fuses Asian style with sustainable, Eastern European supply chains and local production\n*[https://fine-threads.com/ Fine Threads] \u2012 An Indian collaboration between two sisters, one with a background in fashion design the other with a background in business; many pieces again made by [https://saheliwomen.com Saheli Women]\n*[https://www.facebook.com/pg/yadeeyajaishop/ Yadeeyajai] and [https://giftbywish.blogspot.com GiftByWish] \u2012 Sisters in Thailand who employ local tailors at living wages by catering to an international market for Asian-inspired, everyday fashion\n*[https://www.etsy.com/shop/xiaolizi Xiaolizi] \u2012 Chinese shop with durable, feminine fashion incorporating timeless cross-cultural styles, employing local tailors while catering to an international market; also sell [[cottagecore]]\n*[https://in.pinterest.com/babynbaba/khadiwear-in-style/ KhadiWear In Style] \u2012 Pinterest collection of emancicore images, drawing upon traditional Indian khadi\n*[https://www.thebetterindia.com/188836/pune-lifestyle-engineer-khadi-spinning-workshop-make-own-clothes-charkha-india/ Sahasrabudhe and Khadi] \u2012 Inspiration from India on quality khadi, cottage industry, and personal liberation\n\n===Emancicore Architecture===\nAn emancicore home should have an architecture largely consistent with its regional style (honoring regional insights of what works well in a given place), should be will-insulated (to reduce ongoing heating and cooling costs), should be well-built (to reduce ongoing maintenance costs), and should incorporate clear elements that require expert labor to craft (e.g., timber-frame construction, plaster work for in-wall alcoves), and/or are rarely seen in non-custom homes (e.g., a courtyard, integrated greenhouse, long back porch, clerestory windows, a butterfly roof for a deck). These are standards even if the emancicore home incorporates tremendous embodied energy (e.g., using insulated concrete forms). \n\n===Emancicore Practice===\nEmbracing emancicore entails:\n\n*A pre-theoretic aesthetic practice by which (1) people living in \"core\" nations of the world system incorporate into their own aesthetic (vis., their own sense of artistic harmony) handicrafts that originate from, or are handmade locally using techniques that originate from, \"peripheral\" nations of the world system; (2) people living in \"peripheral\" nations of the world system fuse cultural elements from other peripheral nations into their own artistic productions.\n*A pre-theoretic orientation that unites artisans across cultures in unapologetic cross-pollination, rejecting condemnations of \"cultural appropriation\" as evidence of bourgeois alienation from co-production. Here, \"artisans\" are understood as people who produce goods or services that bear a personal \"stamp\" because the producers have sufficient voice in decisions about what they will produce and how and when they will produce it that they are not alienated from their labor.\n*A pre-theoretic embrace of the elements of geographically foreign artistry\u2014often via local friends of different cultures\u2014while both explicitly not attempting to mirror, adopt wholesale, or attempt to \"fit in\" as a member of that culture and, also, while explicitly rejecting any attempts to mass produce whatever fusion may result.\n\n===Emancicore Discourse===\nInviting the Periphery Into the Middle<br>\n(As a Member of a Subsidiary Power, Not As An Elite with Access to the Center):\n\n*[https://youtu.be/kSa6nXa4QfI Postcolonial Concepts: Center and Periphery] | [https://www.coursera.org/lecture/learnerdifferences/rethinking-center-periphery-4ZILH Rethinking Center & Periphery]\n*[https://www.coursera.org/lecture/learnerdifferences/postcolonial-aesthetics-in-theory-NWk0M Reconsidering Postcolonial Aesthetics as Precursors to Postcolonial Theory]\n*[https://www.coursera.org/lecture/learnerdifferences/practices-of-postcolonial-aesthetics-1-EDIco Practices of Postcolonial Aesthetics (1)] | [https://www.coursera.org/lecture/learnerdifferences/practices-of-postcolonial-aesthetics-2-ZepeS Practices of Postcolonial Aesthetics (2)]\n\n[[Category:Fashion]]\n[[Category:Core Suffix]]"}}}]}}}}
