It involves\u00a0seeking new\u00a0food\u00a0experiences as a hobby rather than simply eating out of convenience or hunger. The Foodie aesthetic, however, is dedicated to showing off these foods in very aesthetically pleasing manners. You may also take note of the color combinations, plating arrangement, and composition in their photographs.\n\n== Visual==\n[[File:Why Does Food in Anime Look So Good - Why, Anime? - Get In The Robot|left|thumb|150x150px|A breakdown of food in anime and why it always looks so good.]]\nMost foodie shows provide a strong emphasis on food. Be it cooking shows, shows that involve a host traveling to different locales to sample the food of a particular restaurant, reality shows centered around cooking, or works of fiction centered entirely around food, such as the anime ''Food Wars'' or the Jon Favreau movie ''Chef''. On top of this, there are several popular YouTube channels that Foodies will watch what generally falls into the same category as examples mentioned above of shows and movies.\n\n== Music==\n\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0MfCYyfked6jY1jGinX1sy?si=JE_POx98QMGC_nJNN1lIFQ Foodies Challange\ud83d\ude0a Spotify playlist by 11131271216] (This playlist is collaborative.

There is potential for it to cross over with\u00a0[[Lovecore]] (because what says \"I love you\" more than fresh baked goods). There's even a mild home for Bakery aesthetics with the various Academia aesthetics because what better way to help you focus on studying (besides some chill music) than some baked goods and\u00a0coffee?\n\n====Related Media====\n\n*Cake Boss\n*Cupcake Wars\n*Nailed It\n*The Great British Baking Show\n\n====Music ====\n\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7KNkdkxQGNmBQjkHpATqbe?si=hfUKzCp0TFq-WBeuQNaOUQ French Bakery Spotify playlist by Peatmoss]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1RdogQVOqkbskrLxja9W5C?si=Y5RmNIV9TX2-LPfaTCJRcg Bakery playlist Spotify playlist by Haylee Beach Shaddock]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6N64hGakVM5XOJxcZd0EYt?si=yqWZKYWsR8-Wz0a7sDY2Kg WET SIDE BAKERY Spotify playlist by elita] (This playlist is collaborative.
