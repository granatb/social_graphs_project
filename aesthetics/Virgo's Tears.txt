The art also has a philosophical tone along with the feeling of understanding and appreciation of togetherness, the goal of growing into the bright bloom we want to be, to change and grow, to live a life full of our own beauty, inside and out. There is also an urge to surround oneself with friends and help them grow and bloom as well. Out-of-body experiences and ideals that connect many facets of your personality give a wider spectrum of perspective, as opposed to the simplicity of a single. \n== Fashion ==\nFashion consists of many layers and/or strange arrangements, whether as a wildflower, or a carefully cultivated bloom, the end goal is to find ones natural beauty and express it outward. This may include mixing clothing items that may pertain to other aesthetics such as [[Bloomcore]] and [[Spacecore]], [[witchcore]] and [[Synthwave]], or another mix; or showing a style that may seem unorthodox or unnatural to other types of fashion and clothing. \n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery orientation=\"none\" widths=\"130\">\n\nVirgo-space-drawing.png\nEuphoria.jpg\nPurple-space.jpg\n\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Visual]]\n[[Category:Needs work]]"}}}]}}}}
