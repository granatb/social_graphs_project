However, from the mid 19th century onwards, the aesthetic has distanced itself from strictly religious imagery, and the day is celebrated in a mostly non-religious way. The specific day is on December 25th, but the imagery associated with the holiday appears from November to the end of December.   \n\nThe visuals associated with Christmas originated from various cultural traditions throughout Western Europe and the United States. As globalization, immigration, and cultural sharing occur, the traditions have been assimilated to a more concrete idea of what is expected at Christmas. This is especially true with the popularity of Christmas-related movies, which communicate the spirit and visuals annually. \n\nThe holiday is highly anticipated, as the traditions are associated with nostalgia, goodwill, family, tradition, and happiness. However, as gift-giving is one of the largest traditions of the season, there is an incredible amount of commercialism present in the season, which is addressed in the criticism section.  \n== Visual ==\nThe colors associated with Christmas are red, green, gold, and white. However, in modern times, multiple colors are utilized.\n\n* Angels\n* Candy canes\n* Christmas trees\n* Cookies, especially sugar with icing\n* Fairy Lights\n* Fireplaces\n* Holly\n* Manger scenes\n* Mistletoe\n* Reindeer\n* Snow imagery, such as snowmen, snowflakes, and snow angels\n* Stars\n* Stockings\n* Wrapped Presents\n* Wreaths\n* Ornaments\n* Toys, specifically recognizable vintage ones such as porcelain dolls, teddy bears, and rocking horses\n\n<br />\n\n== Fashion ==\n''This page is under construction.''\n\n* Fair Isle Sweaters\n* Ugly Christmas Sweaters\n* thick coats\n* snow boots\n* party clothes\n* Santa hats\n* plaid skirts and pants\n* pajamas\n* nightgowns\n* slippers<br />\n== Activities ==\n\n* Baking\n* Family gatherings / family activities\n* Making gingerbread houses\n* Singing Christmas carols\n* Church\n* Tree decorating\n* Drinking hot chocolate<br />\n== Substyles ==\n''This page is under construction.''\n\n=== Summer Christmas ===\nBecause of the Southern Hemisphere having \"opposite\" seasons to the Northern Hemisphere, Christmas in those areas occur in the summer. Additionally, some fans of the holiday in the Northern Hemisphere have \"Christmas in July.\" As such, the traditions and visuals associated with the wintertime, such as snowflake decorations, are ironic.  \n\n=== Beach Christmas ===\n\nThis is somewhat related to the Summer Christmas aesthetic, but includes Christmas ornaments that are specifically beach-related, such as seahorses, starfish, and sand-filled glass bulbs. Coloring is usually a cream and aqua, sometimes with a touch of purple.\n\n=== Victorian Christmas ===\n\nThis aesthetic is influenced by British Christmas traditions from the Victorian era - Christmas stockings with oranges, Christmas crackers, sleigh rides, kissing under mistletoe, going caroling, and trees decorated with cranberries and popcorn. Most of the things associated with Christmas today - such as Santa Claus, Christmas stockings, and gift giving, date back to Victorian times.\n\n== Victorian Christmas Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nFile:Queen victoria christmas tree.jpg|Queen Victoria popularized the Christmas tree\nFile:Thomas nast santa.jpg|Thomas Nast illustrated the first fat version of Santa Claus\nFile:First christmas card.jpg|the first Christmas card\n</gallery><br />\n\n=== Pastel Christmas ===\nThis is an alternate color scheme for Christmas trees, decor, and food.

See the TVTropes article on \"[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasEpisode Christmas Episode]\" for many examples.\n\n<br />\n== Music ==\n\n=== Traditional ===\nTraditional Christmas music includes songs that there are many different covers/versions of. Many of them have Christian themes.

Rather than focusing on Christianity, family, and kindness, many critics claim that Christmas has become a holiday overly centered on shopping and capitalism. \n\nSome more devout Christians also dislike the increased secularization of Christmas. In their perspective, emphasizing Santa Claus and festivities takes away from the origin of the holiday as Jesus Christ's birth. \n\nConversely, Christmas may also be alienating to non-Christians. Because of its ubiquity throughout Western culture, Christmas is expected to be celebrated by all citizens, with those not being able to relate to the traditions being seen as sad and unusual. \n<br />\n\n* \n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nFile:Rudolph christmas.jpg|Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\nFile:Christmas lights outdoor.jpg\nFile:Christmas santas.jpg\nFile:Christmas snow.jpg\nFile:Christmas ornaments.jpg\nFile:Christmas girl.jpg\nFile:Christmas lights.jpg\nFile:Christmas gingerbread house.jpg\nFile:Christmas reindeer.jpg\nFile:Christmas cookies.jpg\nFile:Christmas cocoa.jpg\nFile:Christmas tree up close-131da2c7344d47259ad3e6115b53235f.jpg\nFile:Most-wonderful-time-of-the-year-christmas-aes.jpg\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Seasonal]]\n[[Category:Tradition]]\n[[Category:Gallery]]"}}}]}}}}
