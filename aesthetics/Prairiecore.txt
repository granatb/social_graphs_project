Batsheva Hay describes her inspiration to be the \"eccentric\" tastes of her mother and grandmother. Though inspired by the U.S, Prairiecore is not limited to the United States. Like the American pioneers, this aesthetic finds power in freedom and experimenting with new things by using the old as inspiration. Its fashion has both a traditional and modern variant (Uptown Prairie). Key things are grasslands, cattle, flowers, wheat, and Pioneer related works. Prairiecore emerged from the American boho aesthetic during the 1970's, as an offshoot of the hippie/ flowerchild movement. The brand Gunne Sax by Jessica popularized prairie dresses in boho culture at the time, and continues to influence modern prairiecore style.\n\n==Interests==\n\n*Horseback riding\n*Sewing\n*Baking\n*Reading\n*Picnicking\n*Dancing\n*Swimming\n*Farming\n*Playing string instruments\n*Hanging out with animals\n* Candle making\n\n==Fashion==\n\n===Tops ===\n\n* Blouses\n*Anything with ruffled sleeves\n*Floral pattern\n\n===Bottoms===\n\n*Paperbag pants\n*Long skirts\n*High waist pants\n\n===Accessories===\n\n* Bonnets\n*Straw Hats\n*Aprons\n*Parasols\n*Fans\n*Earrings\n*Lockets\n*Gloves\n*Handbags\n\n===Dresses===\n\n*Prairie dresses\n*Midi dresses\n\n===Shoes===\n\n*Lace up boots\n*Booties\n*Heeled mules\n\n===Stores===\n\n*[https://www.freepeople.com/ Free People]\n*[https://www.madewell.com/ Madewell]\n*[https://shop.mango.com/us Mango]\n*[https://www.target.com/ Target]\n*[https://www.nordstrom.com/ Nordstrom]\n*[https://www.hm.com/entrance.ahtml?orguri=%2F H&M]\n*[https://www.lauraashleyusa.com/ Laura Ashley]\n*Gunne Sax (no longer in production)\n*[https://shopdoen.com/ D\u00d4EN]\n*[https://christydawn.com/ Christy Dawn]\n*[https://meadows-store.com/ Meadows]\n*[https://www.shabbychic.com/ Shabby Chic]\n\n===Miscellaneous===\n\n*Plaid pattern\n*Calico\n*Denim\n\n== Media==\nAlthough this aesthetic has regained popularity since the late 2010's, it initially emerged in the 1970's. Much of the related media, usually television, is from the 1970's. Family shows like ''[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_House_on_the_Prairie_(TV_series) Little House on the Prairie], [https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Waltons The Waltons],'' and some Western films are a part of it. The stories are in the same area, with the main characters growing older and learning about life while living through an 1800s era on a farm. \n\n=== Music ===\nGenre(s): Blue Grass, Country and Americana\n\n* Emmy-Lou Harris\n* First-Aid Kit\n* Trampled By Turtles\n* The Civil Wars\n* Mumford and Sons (2009-2013)\n* Taylor Swift - \"Exile\" (ft.
