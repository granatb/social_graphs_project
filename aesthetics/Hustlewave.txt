It's an amalgamation of [[Futurism]] and right wing economic schools of thought (like Objectivism). Think of the classic rags to riches success story, kid makes cool tech in his garage, fast forward 15 years and he's a techbro blamed for the increase of housing prices in the San Francisco/Bay Area. Hustlewave in its purest form is gaining power and succeeding in life through money rather than politics. Though Hustlewave is also about managing to bring the future to today, and making a profit off of it.  In many ways, Hustlewave is the polar opposite of the anti-capitalist/anti-consumerist notes often found in a genre like [[Vaporwave]] and is the polar opposite; the [[Laborwave]] aesthetic, with it's goal being to become the Techbro/[[Cyberprep]] equivalent to Vaporwave's [[Cyberpunk]].\n\n==Visuals==\nHustlewave visuals are, quite literally, Vaporwave aesthetics without the irony and critique of late-stage capitalism, instead openly embracing late-stage capitalism\n\n==Fashion==\nHustlewave fashion is rarely inexpensive. If you are going for a vintage Hustlewave look it consists of business wear. If you're going for a more modern look invest in techwear, such as tactical belts, black hiking boots, and tactical cargo pants. As icing on the cake, an electric vehicle goes nice with your modern techwear look. This is where the neon comes into play, decorate your onewheel or ebike with neon lights and colors.<br />\n\n== Film & TV==\nFilms to watch to get an idea of Hustlewave\n\n*Jobs (2013)\n*The Social Network (2010)\n*American Psycho (2000)\n*Limitless (2011)\n*Something Ventured (2011)\n*Ctrl+Alt+Compete (2011)\n*The Wolf of Wall Street (2013)\n*The Godfather (1970)<br />\n\n==Music==\nSome music the creator of this aesthetic considers to be the epitome of Hustlewave: \n\n*9 to 5 by Dolly Parton\n* Started From The Bottom by Drake\n*Stronger by Kanye West\n*See Me Now by Kanye West\n*Rise Up by Pennywise\n\nActual Hustlewave music hasn't been created yet, but one could imagine that it's just Vaporwave music without the irony, sarcasm, and melancholic vibe to it (so basically, it would just be the music that's sampled for Vaporwave, but without any of the distortion and effects put onto it and just existing as is before the effects are put on to create the unique soundscape).\n\n== Subgenres ==\n\n=== Spanish Hustlewave ===\nSubgenre of Hustlewave with much more political overtones, promoted by Spanish liberals with the intention of turning Spain into an economic power, following some examples of policy carried out in Madrid.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"135\">\nPSX 20200724 143317.jpg\nPSX 20200724 142517.jpg\n20200723 222713.jpg\nFile:1632305051780.jpg\n</gallery><br />\n[[Category:Wave Suffix]]\n[[Category:Music]]\n[[Category:Fashion]]\n[[Category:Visual]]"}}}]}}}}
