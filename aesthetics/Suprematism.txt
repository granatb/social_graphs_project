It was founded by Kazimir Malevich in Russia, and announced in Malevich's 1915 Last Futurist Exhibition of Paintings 0.10, in St. Petersburg, where he, alongside 13 other artists, exhibited 36 works in a similar style.\n\n== Visual ==\nThe term suprematism refers to an abstract art based upon \"the supremacy of pure artistic feeling\" rather than on visual depiction of objects. Suprematism does not embrace a humanist philosophy which places man at the center of the universe. Rather, Suprematism envisions man\u2014the artist\u2014as both originator and transmitter of what for Malevich is the world's only true reality\u2014that of absolute non-objectivity.\n\n== Artists ==\n* Kazimir Malevich\n* El Lissitsky\n* Ilya Chashnik\n* Lazar Khidekel\n* Alexandra Exter\n* Lyubov Popova\n* Sergei Senkin\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery widths=\"130\" orientation=\"landscape\" spacing=\"small\">\nLissitzky-proun.jpg|A Prounen (El Lissitzky, 1925)\nMalevich-black-square.jpg|Black Square (Kazimir Malevich, 1915)\nMalevich-black-circle.jpg|Black Cicle (Kazimir Malevich, 1924)\nMalevich-suprematism.jpg|Supremus 55 (Kazimir Malevich, 1916)\n</gallery>\n\n[[Category:Movement]]\n[[Category:Visual]]\n[[Category:Art]]\n[[Category:Needs work]]\n[[Category:Art movements]]\n[[Category:Plagiarized]]\n[[Category:Ism suffix]]"}}}]}}}}
