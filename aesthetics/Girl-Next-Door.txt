But usually denotes a girl or woman who appeals to traditional or \u201call-American\u201d gender norms with the allure of purity, simplicity, and charm, with a natural, modest, or effortless beauty.\n\n==Visual==\nThe girl-next-door aesthetic includes lots of pastels, light colors, and airy fabrics. It is often related to suburbia, summer and warmer weather. The aesthetic also lends itself to certain patterns like polka-dots and florals, or anything considered more feminine.   \n\n==Fashion==\nThe most distinctive feature is the fluffy silhouette of the outfits and a cute atmosphere. The colors and designs make it look feminine at a glance, with pastel colors such as pink being the main focus. There are many designs featuring ribbon, ruffles, and lace, and even when sneakers are worn, they are in floral patterns, and the shoelaces are pink.\n*Floral dress\n*Cropped cardigan\n*Ruffled top\n*Soft-tee\n*Flowy skirt\n*Peep-toe heels\n*Ballet flats\n*Boot-cut jeans\n*The color pink\n*Overalls\n*Plush shoulder bags\n*Pastel sweaters\n\n==Media==\n===Comics===\n*Archie Comics\n===Television===\n*Phineas and Ferb\n\n==Music==\n''Under Construction''\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery widths=\"135\" orientation=\"square\" spacing=\"small\">\nD596pVVUUAE1Q84.jpg\nIsabella.png\n0532b333407e3c581f477291d059c643.jpg\nLarme shot.jpg\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Fashion]]\n[[Category:Visual]]\n[[Category:Music]]\n[[Category:Feminine]]\n[[Category:Needs work]]\n[[Category:Candidates for Deletion]]"}}}]}}}}
