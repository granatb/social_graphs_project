Named after the [[Wikipedia:Year 2000 problem|Y2K Bug]], it is characterized by a distinct aesthetic period, encapsulating fashion, hardware design, music, and furnishings shining with tech optimism \u2014 sometimes literally. According to the Y2K Aesthetic Institute, some of its aspects include tight leather pants, silver eyeshadow, shiny clothing, Oakleys, gradients, and Blobitecture. Most Y2K aesthetics rely on the use of technology and slick futuristic looks, signaling the optimism of a new era as the 20th century/2nd millennium progressed into the 21st century/3rd millennium. One of the earliest definers of the Y2K aesthetic is the Designers' Republic, a Sheffield-based graphic design studio best known for their work on the ''Wipeout'' video game franchise and various album artwork. The Y2K era ended in late 2004 and was succeeded by the [[Frutiger Aero]] and [[McBling]] era.\n\nY2K aesthetics could've possibly been inspired by other previous futuristic aesthetics such as [[Retro-Futurism]]. Some elements of Y2K (especially from the earlier portion of the era) would also cross over into the [[Vaporwave]] aesthetic, since it shares Vaporwave's angst towards late-stage capitalism, and its nostalgic desire to retreat into a retrofuturist world promised before Western society entered its current troubled times. However, the Y2K aesthetic has not yet been explored by the Vaporwave scene as much as earlier, more ubiquitous periods (like the '80s\u2013early '90s Neon/[[Synthwave]] aesthetic).<ref>https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/19/year-2000-y2k-millennium-design-aesthetic</ref>\n\n==History==\nFirst major signs of the Y2K aesthetic appeared around 1995 to 1997, with the release of Windows 95, the movie ''Hackers'', the PS1 game ''Wipeout'', and music videos by artists such as Michael and Janet Jackson (\"Scream\"), Puff Daddy (\"Mo Money Mo Problems\"), Will Smith (\"Gettin' Jiggy wit It\", \"Men in Black\"), and the Spice Girls (\"Say You'll Be There\") being done in this style. The Y2K era then took off in full force from 1998 to 2000, with things such as Pokemania, Limp Bizkit, NSYNC, ''TRL'', ''The Matrix'', and Britney Spears hitting their peak popularity. Y2K replaced the Core '90s era which had been known for its darker, more serious tone, with aesthetics such as [[Grunge]]. Y2K peaked around late 1999/early 2000, coinciding with the turn of the millennium and apex of the dot-com bubble.<ref name=\"Papermag\">https://www.papermag.com/the-institute-of-y2k-aesthetics-1814307641.html</ref>\n\nThe Y2K era gradually declined from 2000 to 2004 as the contentious 2000 U.S. presidential election, the dot-com bubble bursting, 9/11, the anthrax scares, and the Iraq War dampened optimism for the new millennium. It finally ended in late 2004, after which it gave way to the [[McBling]] and [[Frutiger Aero]] aesthetics. Although not as popular these days, Y2K culture can still be seen in various circles of the Internet and niche entertainment but is starting to see a bit of a resurgence in its imagery in pop culture as late '90s/early 2000s nostalgia has started coming back in fashion, such as in \"1999\" by Charli XCX, \"2002\" by Anne Marie, and \"Motivation\" by Normani.\n\n== Visuals ==\n[[File:Ivy Hollivana \u2013 Dear Deathwaters (2019)|thumb|300x300px|Perhaps the future of the Y2K Sound?]]\n===Graphics and Art===\nY2K aesthetics use both 2D and 3D art. 2D art usually features thick lines, bold minimalism, and heavy use of iconography. 3D art is more \"blobby\" looking, has more gradients, and generally looks very shiny. Common colors used in Y2K art are, but not limited to, [https://twitter.com/crossniq/status/1156648479273431040 chrome, icy blue, ocean, bright oranges, glossy white, and black (for lineworks).]\n\nOne of the most well-known faces of Y2K art is [https://www.thedesignersrepublic.com/ the Designers Republic], known for their works on the video game series ''[[Wikipedia:Wipeout (series)|Wipeout]]'' as well as various album artwork, especially for artists on the electronica label Warp Records. Founded by Ian Anderson and Nick Phillips in 1986, they were best known for making art that subverts brash consumerism and the uniformity of corporate culture (similar to what Vaporwave has done since then). Like vaporwave, much of their work also drew inspiration from Japanese anime (which was beginning to rise in popularity around the same time).\n\n===Toys and technology===\nBeing that this was the era that the cell phone was first starting to become popular among your average consumer, you can find a lot of nods to the original models of cell phones (such as the original Nokia phones or the clamshell/flip phones) within the Y2K subculture.  Also popular around this time was the Blobject, a type of design product (often a household object) distinguished by smooth flowing curves, bright colors, and an absence of sharp edges. The word is generally held to be a portmanteau, a contraction of \"blob\" and \"object.\"\n\n===Blobitecture===\nBlobitecture, also known as 'blobism\u2019, is a term given to a post-modern architectural style characterized by curved and rounded building shapes, or 'blob architecture'. Blobitecture buildings appear to have an organic form that is soft and free-flowing, yet comes together to produce a complex whole.  Blobitecture buildings started popping up around the late 90's/early 2000s to reflect a lot of the trends at the time, giving the buildings something of a \"futuristic\" look at the time (by the standards of what constituted futuristic at that time period).\n\n==Fashion==\nY2K is a very new concept, but with certain brands that were popular at the time still existing, one could easily predict these brands could potentially play a huge role in Y2K. Basically, you'd either look like a late '90s/early 2000s [[raver]] or a member of a [[Pop|boy band]] from the time.\n\nAlso, it should be noted a lot of [[Holosexual]] aesthetics and style can turn up in Y2K fashion as well (due to its usage in futuristic fashion at the time).\n\n== Media ==\n[[File:Early 2000s Commercials|thumb|A compilation of Y2K-themed commercials.]]\n===Movies===\n\n*''Hackers'' (1995)\n*''The Matrix'' (1999)\n*''Pokemon: The First Movie'' (1999)\n*''Zenon: Girl of the 21st Century'' (1999)\n*''Agent Cody Banks'' (2001)\n*''Osmosis Jones'' (2001)\n*''Minority Report'' (2002)\n*''Spider-Man'' (2002)\n*''The Fifth Element'' (1997)\n*''Charlie's Angels'' (2000)\n*''Blade'' (1998)\n*''Spy Kids'' (2001)\n*''X-Men'' (2000)\n\n===Video Games===\nWhen people think of Y2K gaming, most could tell you about the sixth generation of consoles (Dreamcast, PlayStation 2, Xbox, GameCube, GameBoy Advance) and their respective lines of games. The fifth generation of gaming (PlayStation, Nintendo 64, Sega Saturn, GameBoy Color) also contained early elements of Y2K, bridging the Core '90s into the Y2K Era.\n\nDuring the late '90s and early 2000s, Sega had attempted to make one last console before they went out of business. The Dreamcast, released in 1999, had shown Sega's ability to make creative and innovative games. The most Y2K-esque game was 1999s ''[[Wikipedia:Space Channel 5|Space Channel 5]]'', a rhythm game intended for a \"casual female audience\" that was applauded for its retro art style and soundtrack, encapsulating a lot of what people admired about Y2K aesthetics.\n\nAnother Dreamcast game that could be considered Y2K-inspired is 2000's ''[[Wikipedia:Jet Set Radio|Jet Set Radio]]'', which, while not having the slick designs of ''Space Channel 5'', captured other aspects such as Japanese punk fashion and early 2000s hip-hop. ''Jet Set Radio'' would also use iconography-inspired graphics for its UI. ''[[Wikipedia:Jet Set Radio Future|Jet Set Radio Future]]'', its 2002 sequel, integrated even more Y2K aesthetics into its art and gameplay.\n\nYet more Sega games that embodied this aesthetic are ''[[Wikipedia:Sonic Adventure|Sonic Adventure]]'' (1998), ''[[Wikipedia:Sonic Adventure 2|Sonic Adventure 2]]'' (2001), and ''[[Wikipedia:Sonic Heroes|Sonic Heroes]]'' (2003), particularly ''SA1'' with its janky-yet-charming visuals and atmospheric Y2K music.\n\nOn the Sony end of the spectrum, no game series does a better job of embodying the Y2K aesthetic than the ''[[Wikipedia:Wipeout (series)|Wipeout]]'' series, with art done by the aforementioned Designers Republic, even with recent iterations like ''[[Wikipedia:Wipeout HD|Wipeout HD]]'' (2008) and ''[[Wikipedia:Wipeout 2048|Wipeout 2048]]'' (2012).\n\n''[[wikipedia:Ace_Combat_3:_Electrosphere|Ace Combat 3: Electrosphere]]'' also used a Y2K futurism aesthetic in its user interface, fictional aircraft designs, and soundtrack.\n\nOther companies attempted to use Y2K aesthetics as a promotion for consoles, controllers, and games.\n\nRecently, the Indie game scene started to get inspired by the Y2K revival wave and the developers to revisit the aesthetic. One of the first games is CROSSNIQ+, a puzzle arcade game mimicking the dreamcast puzzles made by Max Kriegler and the upcoming BombRush cyberfunk and Neon White.\n\n==Music==\n[[File:Ivy Hollivana \u2013 Breaking Point (2019)|thumb]]\nSince Y2K was about embracing the future, the tone of [https://twitter.com/crossniq/status/1151569315205959680 music] also reflected this. Electronic music was the go-to genre to capture this era as a musician.\n\nThe most well-known music associated with Y2K is [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_beat big beat], a subgenre of electronic music that used \"heavy breakbeats and synthesizer-generated loops and patterns\". Bands such as the Prodigy, Fatboy Slim, the Crystal Method, Junkie XL and Propellerheads performed this music during the '90s. However, the genre has since become less prevalent in the mainstream, with modern examples being few and far in between.\n\nOther genres used during the Y2K era were [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jungle_music jungle], [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drum_and_bass drum n' bass] and trance. Much like big beat (and what ultimately inspired big beat to begin with), these genres have a heavy emphasize on techno-style music, with fast beats and use of synthesizers. To this day, these genres are still used in EDM scenes all over.\n\nBubblegum [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurodance eurodance] was also common during the Y2K era. Aqua, the band responsible for the 1997 hit \"Barbie Girl\", is often attributed as being the most popular example of this genre, with an honorable mention going to Eiffel 65, known for their 1998 single \"Blue (Da Ba Dee)\".\n\nThe Y2K aesthetic can also be seen in the music video to the Red Hot Chili Peppers' \"Californication\". The video takes the form of a fictional open-world video game that depicts each of the band members on an adventure in a California setting.\n\nR&B and hip-hop also transitioned from the Golden Age/Gangsta Rap & G-Funk Era into the Bling/Shiny Suit/Jiggy Era. Many hip-hop artists used Y2K aesthetics in music videos, such as TLC in their \"No Scrubs\" video, though on the Y2K Aesthetics Institute, there is a lyrics video for an artist named \"Ivy Hollivana\", who seems to invoke a lot of the Y2K imagery in her music videos, so she could potentially be to Y2K Music as Daniel Lopatin or James Ferraro were for Vaporwave.\n\n\n==Y2K in modern culture==\nSome have taken an interest in the aesthetic in recent times. The Y2K Aesthetic Institute (run by [https://twitter.com/FroyoTam Froyo Tam] and [https://twitter.com/EvanCollins90 Evan Collins]) archive parts of the aesthetic, such as graphic designs, flyers, game console designs, video game concept art, fashion, etc. They chronicle both art from the era the aesthetic was popular, as well as modern depictions of the aesthetic. Tam has also made [https://github.com/froyotam/ferrite-core/ Ferrite Core DX] and other open-source typefaces inspired by Y2K typography.\n\nAnother example of modern-Y2K aesthetics being used is the indie puzzle game known as [https://store.steampowered.com/app/1128180/CROSSNIQ/ ''CROSSNIQ+''], which utilizes the more bold, thick-line aesthetics seen in Y2K cartoon styles. Also run by Krieger and The Y2K Institute is [https://hubs.mozilla.com/ruiW2Ut/u-r-here-official u::r::here], a free virtual gallery dedicated to showing off Y2K art and aesthetics.\n\nSo far there is only one community forum that is based on Y2K aesthetics and that is [https://forum.agoraroad.com/index.php Agora Road's Macintosh Cafe]. Which coins itself as a \"nostalgic Y2K community\".\n\nThe aesthetic seems to be breaking into pop culture, such as the Charli XCX and Troye Sivan song [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-v1b9waHWY 1999].\n\n[https://soundcloud.com/d-video DV-i] is a music artist seeking to revive the feel of Y2K techno. Porter Robinson (under the alias of [https://soundcloud.com/virtualself Virtual Self]) also creates Y2K-inspired electronic music. [https://soundcloud.com/dance_system Dance System] incomporates Y2K visuals and ambient into 2000's house music in his debut album Where's the party at?.\n\n<br />\n\n==Resources==\nExternal links to help get a better understanding of this aesthetic.\n\n*[https://twitter.com/y2k_aesthetic Y2K Institute Twitter]\n*[https://y2kaestheticinstitute.tumblr.com/ Y2K Institute Tumblr]\n*[https://www.instagram.com/y2kaesthetic/ Y2K Institute Instagram]\n*[https://twitter.com/crossniq CROSSNIQ+ Twitter]\n*[https://twitter.com/here_gallery u::r::here Twitter]\n*[http://www.thedesignersrepublic.com/ The Designers Republic]\n\n===Vendors===\n\n*[https://jnco.com/ JNCO]\n*[http://www.kikwear.com/ Kikwear]\n*[https://www.shopufojeans.com/collections UFO]\n*[https://www.bewild.com/ BeWild]\n*[https://www.cyberdog.net Cyberdog]\n*[https://aikafuture.theshop.jp Aika Electronics]\n\n===Playlists===\n\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5Vmr9p9Na2jn6JFz5Y4Fc8?si=DffJJqyWT0GQHd0GEsmmCw Y2K Rap Spotify playlist by Rose Bennett]\n\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5Z2mBLHSK4IwsP4zTqGXKn?si=pK110R5hRq2hzLmWsY0ARg Y2K Pop Spotify playlist by Alec Dawson]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/69mayVTLhnFYo4rVfzShFO?si=rfC5XWHsSIW1NFFpuYJ6gg Y2K Spotify playlist by m.quintos1]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7M2xWyktvoDiiT5VQwnK24?si=P18Dew4YRi-jz66vqhxG9A y2k Spotify playlist by achooro]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5FZkIFBByFD39UFYChpLWQ?si=_rO6Z3dqQMq-M6TU4KKCpA Y2K (Early 00's) Spotify playlist by Indie Monster]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2EdBVW39jLLvRPbz3GVbMN?si=b9f0mE9uQcGD_F8awQfSeg Y2K ANGEL Spotify playlist by josephina666]\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"130\" orientation=\"none\">\nTumblr or47w9ZmRs1v0jfsto3 1280.jpg\nTumblr oivwukbROc1v0jfsto8 1280.jpg\nTumblr oivwukbROc1v0jfsto7 1280.jpg\nTumblr oivwukbROc1v0jfsto5 1280.jpg\nTumblr oetnhnECsl1v0jfsto6 1280.jpg\nTumblr oetnhnECsl1v0jfsto4 r1 1280.jpg\nTumblr oetnhnECsl1v0jfsto2 1280.jpg\nTumblr oivwukbROc1v0jfsto3 1280.jpg\nTumblr oivwukbROc1v0jfsto2 1280.jpg\nTumblr oetnhnECsl1v0jfsto8 1280.jpg\nTumblr oetnhnECsl1v0jfsto3 r1 1280.jpg\nTumblr oetnhnECsl1v0jfsto1 1280.jpg\nTumblr oivwukbROc1v0jfsto9 1280.jpg\nTumblr oivwukbROc1v0jfsto10 1280.jpg\nTumblr oivwukbROc1v0jfsto4 1280.jpg\nBc779dc44691ecbea22ca60f70b12940.jpg\nOo shine.jpg\nImage about fashion in 2000\u2019s vibes \ud83d\udca6 by drea.jpg\nY2K Aesthetic Institute.jpg\nSpace Channel 5 for the Sega Dreamcast .jpg\nCyb.jpg\nR-267184-1333045868.jpeg.jpg\n2009BX8549.jpg\nApple-imac-g3-anniversary.jpg\nR-5712435-1402080066-6382.jpeg.jpg\nD2TDIFqU8AIRefz.png|Y2K Fonts\n4190c569594ae28e211e0ef243fb5895.png\nD2d51VaUYAAFUGh.png\n453a8d2e7ccfc4f490ef0745ebdf0f76.png\nD0ZUOVRUcAAlAci.jpg\nR-3844693-1363050053-6319.jpeg.jpg\n3e00ebf16d6aebb72d8b6cc18c7dba9d.jpg\nDwppzSFUUAAj-J9.jpg\nTLC - No Scrubs-0|The quintessential Y2K aesthetic in action\nBlob.PNG|An example of Blobitecture\nFile:CyberKei.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n*\n\n[[Category:Visual]]\n[[Category:Music]]\n[[Category:Fashion]]\n[[Category:Vintage]]\n[[Category:Recognized Community]]\n[[Category:1990s]]\n[[Category:2000s]]"}}}]}}}}
