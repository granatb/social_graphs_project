It is closely associated with [[Raver|raving]] or just good old-fashioned partying (similar to [[Cuddle Party]]), though it can have ties to the old [[Hippie]] culture.\n\n== Visuals ==\nGlowwave aesthetics focus on things like glow sticks, lasers, and anything that either glows in the dark or is able to glow under a blacklight. It can also include things you can find in arcades, skating rinks, and raves and a lot of the psychedelic blacklight posters that were popular amongst the Hippie subculture of the 60s and 70s (and many stoners have in the modern-day).\n\n== Fashion ==\nGlowwave fashion consists of any clothing that can either glow in the dark or is reactive to blacklights (aka glows under blacklight), and accessories are anything that can light up. Glowwave hair and make-up can also be glow in the dark or blacklight-reactive as well.  Light-Up/Glow in the Dark things such as Backpacks, shoes, nail polish, t-shirts, pants, jewelry, etc. are often utilized as part of the Glowwave aesthetic.  It's about being as bright and vivid as possible.  Other elements can include:\n\n* Bright, Vibrant colors\n* Pastels (since some pastel colors can show up some in UV light)\n* Glowing in the dark nails, makeup, backpacks, shoes, etc\n* Glowstick accessories\n* Baggy/vibrant shirt\n* Bright Headbands\n* Brightly-color shoes or boots\n* Brightly-Colored Hair that's been dyed with UV-reactive colors\n\n== Activities ==\n* Raves\n* Laser Tag\n* Arcades\n* Black Light Bowling\n* Black Light Miniature Golf\n* Roller Skating\n* Drawing with UV-reactive substances (paint, crayons, markers, pencils etc.)\n\n== Music ==\nWhile there aren't any known examples of Glowwave music, adherents to the Glowwave aesthetic may listen to EDM, [[Lo-Fi]], [[Synthwave]], [[Vaporwave]], [[Acidwave]], [[Psychedelica]], [[Nintencore|Chiptune]], and possibly some [[Raver|Madchester]]. If you can dance to it or just vibe to it, it has a place in the Glowwave library.\n\n== Subgenres ==\n=== Arcadecore ===\nArcadecore is a particular subgenre of Glowwave with a heavy focus on how it felt to be a kid in the 80's or 90's, running around an arcade; something of a crossroads between [[Vaporwave]] and [[Kidcore]]. This aesthetic includes cheap plastic toys, neon signs, pizza, arcade games like Donkey Kong and Pac-Man, the patterns on the carpet floor, etc.  It can also draw a lot of heavy influence from arcades of the 80's and 90's, which can include a lot of neon colors, arcade cabinets, ticket booths, arcade tokens, etc. Arcade pizzerias that were popular in the time like Showbiz Pizza, Chuck E. Cheese, and businesses of that nature (which can lead to a lot of crossover with the Five Nights At Freddy's franchise) are another influence.  The fashion is generally pretty low-key; a simple pair of jeans/shorts/skirt, t-shirts or hoodies centered around retro arcade games and retro-themed kids products, cheap plastic costume jewelry, simple sneakers (or light-up ones if you feel like getting fancy), it's not an overly flashy aesthetic fashion-wise, considering what it's source material is, though that isn't to say that this couldn't change in the future.\n\n<br />\n\n== Resources ==\nExternal links to help get a better understanding of this aesthetic.\n\n=== Vendors ===\n\n*[https://moodhoops.com/# MoodHoops]\n*[https://www.manicpanic.com/ Manic Panic]\n*[https://iroirocolors.com/ Iroiro]\n*[https://www.uniqso.com/ Uniqso]\n*[https://www.mooncreations.com/ Moon Creations]\n*[https://stardustleds.com/?ref=ilizlmq5pf9 Stardust LEDs]\n*[https://runerefinery.com/ Rune Refinery]\n*[https://volgaverdi.com/ Volga Verdi]\n*[https://www.shopufojeans.com/ UFO]\n*[https://squareup.com/market/monkey-bunny Monkey Bunny]\n*[https://spacetribe.com/ Space Tribe]\n*[https://stonebrookjewelry.com/ Stonebrook Jewelry]\n*[https://www.chemi-on.com/en/index.html Chemi-On]\n*[https://tempestrings.com/ Tempest Rings]\n*[https://glofx.com/ GloFX]\n*[https://www.bewild.com/ BeWild]\n*[https://www.publicbetawear.com/ Public Beta]\n*[https://www.etereshop.com/ Etere] (if you have the money for it...)\n*[https://www.mysecretwoods.com/ My Secret Woods]\n*[https://www.carbonfi.com/ CarbonFi]\n*[http://www.kikwear.com/ Kikwear]\n*[https://www.ultrapoi.com/ UltraPoi]\n*[https://patrickadairdesigns.com/ Patrick Adair Designs]\n*[https://www.tetramode.com/ Tetramode]\n*[https://yourmindyourworld.com/ Your Mind Your World]\n*[https://www.electricstyles.com/ Electric Styles]\n*[https://www.glowcity.com/ Glow City]\n*[https://www.cyberdog.net/ Cyberdog]\n*[https://innerartworld.com/ Inner Art World]\n*[https://inlighten.co/ Inlighten]\n*[https://allovershirts.com/collections/lumi%20?rfsn=896323.96b75 All-Over Shirts by Lumi]\n*[https://futuristiclights.com/ Futuristic Lights]\n\n=== Playlists ===\n\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5w8pw7egCzdVVOFyelb1Bg?si=EJdVVCImRr2czp3aho2uUg arcadecore Spotify playlist by victoria.foss-us]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5ibPi26elhuKZWU9rGpFEt?si=GXefMgaTRmaAMury2uJjrA arcadecore Spotify playlist by Aster Van Alboom]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3GLWfJDf9MOskLwwaKOnk2?si=UHllDj1KQEyay2eXnR_eaw arcadecore || future bass mix Spotify playlist by missmusicallymadhatter]\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery widths=\"130\" bordercolor=\"#00FF00\" orientation=\"landscape\">\nMy Post.jpg|A Glowwave Mood Board (image by helpidontknowwhatmyaestheticis over on the Aesthetics Wiki Discord)\nLe1f supersuper overhead.jpg\nTumblr pth7gjFrH91v602fp 1280.jpg|The best move to make is not to...\nTumblr pth7gl8ThY1v602fp 640.png\nTumblr pth7gi8vsm1v602fp 400.jpg\nTumblr pth7gkM9lU1v602fp 1280.jpg\nTumblr pth7gh6XZ51v602fp 1280.jpg\n05f95a8e-2b62-41b5-a22f-8bfd78648ac3.octet-stream.jpg\n67937f62-11b5-4a15-ae50-d616532763fe.octet-stream.jpg\n73018b99-7441-45a3-9b60-01f01b5a6648.octet-stream.jpg\nImageshdhjchbcehjh.jpeg\nRetro arcade.jpg\n1442257459270.jpg\nMaxresdefaultglow.jpg\n687474~1.GIF\n822117d08fef9e5755b7adf937eb0ca3.png\nSource2.gif\nTwo Girls GIF.gif\nGlowwave.jpg\nArcadecore.jpg|arcadecore\nNeon carnival arcade.jpg\nNeon carnival sign.jpg\nRf071da1601fd2553100c9794a22b2636.jpg\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Visual]]\n[[Category:Wave Suffix]]\n[[Category:Fashion]]\n[[Category:Electronic]]"}}}]}}}}
