The term is derived from the Japanese pronunciation of <nowiki>''underground''</nowiki>, which refers to its origins in underground theater. \n\n==Angura Theater==\nFrom everything that influences angura kei, the strongest influence is underground theater. Before it has become a style, it was mostly worn by actors in plays during 60-70s.\n\n==Fashion==\nThe clothes tend to be heavily influenced by traditional Japanese elements as well as the Showa era (1926-1989) but with a Goth spin to it. The make-up usually consists of [[shironuri]], and is dark and heavy. While kimono are the most common used by visual kei artist, the style also often features modified japanese school uniforms. Motifs and accessories are themed around post-war Japan and the occult.\n\n==Music==\n\n* [https://open.spotify.com/artist/2OfxY8WbbZZu7GiRJLb0P5 MUCC]\n* [https://open.spotify.com/artist/57ylq99KYx8ccdqwqqxGnx Inugami Circus-dan]\n* [https://open.spotify.com/artist/3BaFPLRyegWr3dCE1a4HUX Strawberry Song Orchestra]\n*Shinjuku Gewalt\n*Zombie Lolita\n* [https://open.spotify.com/artist/1HO2fk3WKPWXNEUqPvDZmU cali\u2260gari]\n*Guruguru Eigakan\n\n== Resources ==\nExternal links to help get a better understanding of this aesthetic.\n\n=== Vendors ===\n\n*[https://matchingmole.shopselect.net/ Matching Mole]\n\n=== Pinterest Boards ===\n\n* [https://www.pinterest.com/mariecat71725/angura-kei/ Angura Kei by Maggie.M]\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"135\" orientation=\"portrait\">\nTumblr inline p6l89hEtJD1tfse7s 1280.jpg\nEY8c4B5U8AELkM2.jpg\n1496690205945.jpg\nA.k\nAngura_kei_fashion.jpg\n</gallery><gallery>\n\n\n\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Kei Suffix]]\n[[Category:Visual]]\n[[Category:Music]]\n[[Category:Fashion]]\n[[Category:Japanese]]\n[[Category:Needs work]]"}}}]}}}}
