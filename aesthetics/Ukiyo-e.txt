Its artists produced woodblock prints and paintings of such subjects as female beauties; kabuki actors and sumo wrestlers; scenes from history and folk tales; travel scenes and landscapes; flora and fauna; and erotica.\n\nUkiyo-e displays an unusual approach to graphical perspective, one that can appear underdeveloped when compared to European paintings of the same period.\n\nTypical subjects of Ukiyo-e paintings were female beauties, kabuki actors, and landscapes. The women depicted were most often courtesans and geisha at leisure, and promoted the entertainments to be found in the pleasure districts.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nGeisha-and-servant.jpg\nHikone-screen.jpg\nTwo-beauties-with-bamboo.jpg\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Needs work]]\n[[Category:Japanese]]\n[[Category:Art]]\n[[Category:Art movements]]"}}}]}}}}
