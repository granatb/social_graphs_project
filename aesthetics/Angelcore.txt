The aesthetic is designed to emulate the same unearthly beauty that European angels are described and depicted with, though it can also include non-European angel aesthetics. This can be done with modern or older presentation methods. The Angelcore aesthetic is not always explicitly religious and sometimes involves [[SacriCore|sacrilege]]. Users of these aesthetic are not necessarily religious. \n\n==Visuals==\n*Gold\n*Cupid \n*Pink \n*Glitter\n*Keys\n*Butterflies\n*Flowers, especially roses\n*Small, ornate patterns\n*Hearts\n*Mirrors\n*The sky\n*Clouds\n*Light\n*Wings\n*Harps\n*Halos\n*Tears\n*Reflections\n*Highlights & shadows \n*Cherubs\n*Columns\n\n===Resources===\nA list of external links to help get a better understanding of this aesthetic.\n\n===Pinterest Boards===\n\n*[https://www.pinterest.com/kuraginax/angelcore/ \u2014 angelcore by vinny\ud83e\udd40]\n*[https://www.pinterest.com/fr0gpicnic/angelcore/ angelcore by d a i s y]\n*[https://www.pinterest.com/babbibunne/angelcore/ angelcore by baby]\n*[https://www.pinterest.com/marsssbarsss/angelcore/ angelcore by mars.mp4]\n*[https://br.pinterest.com/silverz_/aesthetic/angelcore/ Aesthetic \u2666\ufe0e Angelcore \u2666\ufe0e by Silverz]\n*[https://www.pinterest.com/mariecat71725/angelcore/ Angelcore by Maggie.M]\n*[https://pin.it/4X5CeQ7 \u00b0 angelcore by faedearest]\n\n\n\n\n==Fashion==\n\n*Silk and sheer fabrics\n*Lace\n*Feathers\n*Long, flowing, light clothing\n*Nightgowns and coords\n*Flowers and floral patterned clothing\n*Crosses\n*Rosaries\n*Ballet flats\n*Light or natural makeup\n*Fake halos and fake wings\n*Dresses\n*Jewellery\n\n==Food==\n*Angel cake \n*Coconut \n*Meringues \n\n==Media==\n\n=== Movies ===\n\n*''The Sacrifice'' (1986)\n*''Wings of Desire'' (1987)\n*''Faraway, So Close!''

'''Cherubcore''' focuses on the feelings and values portrayed by heavenly cherubs and the small, sweet, baby-like innocence of the figures that differ from the divine essence of angels. There is often a distinct crossover in this aesthetic with Angelcore and [[Babycore]], with a hint of [[Lovecore]] now and then due to the similarity between cherubs and the mythical figure Cupid. The visuals of cherubcore are the same as angelcore but add more fun visuals like candy, cherubs laughing in paintings, hearts, porcelain figures, and child's toys. There are lots of pinks and whites involved as well. Fashion has a very similar overlap to [[Nymphet]] and [[Babycore]], with youthful and childlike articles of clothing and accessories.<gallery widths=\"103\" orientation=\"square\">\nBabycore blanky.jpg\nBabycore dress and teddy.jpg\nAngel Oil Painting.jpg\nCloud painting.jpg\nRosy Angels.jpg\nAngelcoreaesthetic1.jpg\nCherub.jpg\nCute hello Kitty \ud83d\udc31 discovered by love pink on We Heart It.jpeg\nImage about pink in SWEET by Hope K on We Heart It (1).jpg\nWhite Soft Clouds.jpg\n(AES) babycore pink bedroom.jpeg\nBook flowers.webp\n1f8e29f6ff02ff45fa3352a58a345d0f.jpg\nSky..jpg\nCuteeeeeeee.jpg\n2a60dcb93cd6305bbb197d2355c3272d.jpeg\n</gallery><br />\n=== Fallen Angel ===\nThe '''Fallen Angel''' aesthetic''',''' also known as dark/goth angelcore''',''' takes angelcore and adds more somber themes and dark visual tones while still providing the essences of ethereal and other-worldy. Many of the themes of fallen angel involve feelings of \"falling from grace\" or unworthiness/not wanting to be placed on a pedestal like angels are commonly portrayed. The aesthetic itself can both exude feelings of peace and radiance or sorrow and malice depending on the camp presented.  \n\nCommon motifs for fallen angels include angel statues, black wings, flowing white and/or black fabrics, fire, halos, horns and tails, the sky and the ground, snakes, and much more. Visually, there is a crossover with [[Dark Naturalism]], which exhibits dark, misty visuals of nature. Other visuals can overlap with [[Traumacore]] and [[Grunge]], employing angelic motifs mixed with heavy melancholy themes. Fashion takes regular angelcore and turns it black, almost [[Goth|gothic]]. It can also take an aforementioned Grunge route.  \n\nThis aesthetic can focus on criticizing the Catholic religion, sharing similar aspects of reasoning with [[SacriCore|Sacricore]]. Common topics include excommunication, religious trauma, and mental illness. Often this is mixed with the aforementioned feelings of falling from grace or feeling tainted, and potentially being cast out of a religion or choosing to leave it.  \n\n==== Media ====\n\n* ''The Shadowhunter Chronicles'' by Cassandra Clare\n* ''The Infernal Devices''\n* ''The Dark Artifices''\n* ''City of Bones'' (2013)\n\n==== Visual Boards ====\n\n* [https://www.pinterest.com/XraphX/dark-angelcore/ dark angelcore by raphael] \n\n* [https://www.pinterest.com/officialoutsiders/dark-angelcore-aesthetic/ Dark angelcore aesthetic by Maddy] \n* [https://www.pinterest.com/valentineartss/fallen-angel/ fallen angel by sienna]\n* [https://www.pinterest.com/lilithsxangel/fallen-angel/ fallen angel by alexis]\n* [https://www.pinterest.com/GoddessA8/fallen-angel-aesthetic/ Fallen Angel Aesthetic by Artemis]\n\n==== Music ====\n\n* [https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0lDArwoQ6AQ1nEOa7SPbRx fallen // angel by taste in music]\n* [https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5Ul4VFUlAEAl4KC9XVadN4 fallen angels by lillian :)]\n* [https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2WdaXO7lOF8xcbXLsNQrli fallen angels. by milkynoir]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl5n5OopKso extinguish me by soap&skin]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i190q5WzRHo fairytale by kalafina]\n\n==== Resources ====\n\n* [https://seraphimfall.tumblr.com/ Seraphimfall on Tumblr]\n* [https://black-feathers-float.tumblr.com/ black-feathers-float on Tumblr]\n*[https://angelic-riot.tumblr.com/ angelic-riot on Tumblr]\n\n<br /><gallery spacing=\"small\" orientation=\"square\" widths=\"103\">\nDark-angel-fallen.jpg\nFire-with-fire.jpg\nDark-angel.jpg\nDark-angel-grunge.jpg\nBlack-feathers-hair-yellow-eye.jpg\nDarknature6.jpg\nDark-angel-statue.jpg\nDark-angel-sky.jpg\nBlack-wings-sitting.jpg\nFire-hand.png\nDark-angel-falling.jpg\nBlack-angel-outfit.jpg\nAngels-impure.jpg\nEye-rolled.jpg\nFlying-angel-dark.jpg\nAngel-demon-pair-silhouette.jpg\nYearning-statue-dark.jpg\nLightning-struck.jpg\nFile:Angelp2.jpg\nFile:Angelp4.jpeg\n</gallery><br />\n\n=== Biblical Angel ===\nBiblical Angels are taken from the biblical depiction of angels, rather than the altered humanistic version created by the media. There are various sections of the Bible where angels and cherubs are described, including Ezekiel 1:5-11, Isaiah 6:2, Job 38:7, Ps 8:5, Ac 26:13, and Re 1:20. These verses and many others describe angels as hot, pure energy, and frightening to humans. This is a popular subject in art and can be seen across media. Often times they are depicted as half human, half animal or as energy balls with a thousand eyes circling around it with six wings. \n\nThis subject focuses on the reality of divinity and the terrifying truth that had been covered up by mainstream society over history. The overall theme of the biblical angel aesthetic is questionsing monstrosity and fear, and presenting truth to those living in ignorance. It is both ethereal and horrifying, and has a subcommunity for those who identify with these depictions. These communities also use their art of biblical angels to portray the previously mention themes, as well as humor. Being ethereal and mysterious, feeling \"too big your body\", and a deep philosophical nature can accompany the moods of this aestheic.  \n\n==== Visual Boards and Art ====\n[https://www.pinterest.com/mamka0288/biblical-angelsseraphim/ biblical angels/seraphim by ann_dvach]  [https://www.pinterest.com/Icely_me/biblical-angels/ Biblical angels by Kaylinne]  [https://www.pinterest.com/demonb0ii/biblical-angels/ biblical angels by M]\n<br />\n\n==== Resources ====\n\n* [https://tomato-bird.tumblr.com/ tomato-bird on Tumblr]\n* [https://serrangelic-art.tumblr.com/ serrangelic-art on tumblr]\n* [https://cherriielle.tumblr.com/ cherriielle on tumblr]\n* [https://www.facebook.com/groups/396518874718830 \"Ah yes, biblically accurate angels\" Facebook group]\n\n<br /><gallery widths=\"185\">\nAccurate angel.jpg\nAccurate angel art.jpg\nBa twitter.jpg\n1_ZmjlkG-eVB4GmZeHLC-hNQ.jpeg|ezekiel's wheel (an angel)\n1_YXxbbvBjoHtRfz0W-HiwIQ.jpeg|An angel by julius bates\n</gallery><br />\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"104\" orientation=\"none\" spacing=\"medium\">\nAngelcore.jpg\nAngelcoreaesthetic1.jpg\n68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f41757954477530476f624f6e6d513d3d2d332e313566376665316631653130316638323631303138353634393433322e6a7067.jpeg\nAngel Oil Painting.jpg\nDownload (34).jpeg\n68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f5f4670374a6d43524b417a6e42513d3d2d342e3136306664363865613539363261376636343938383234353332342e6a7067.jpeg\n\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc4e \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc60 \ud835\udc54\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc52 \ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc52 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc62 \ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc52 -.jpeg\nCloud.jpg\n96c4e3efbc7d7def637637e41c51bdc5.jpg\n920aebaf499fa1ee1bda5e287645b928.jpg\n976d57e5616df5a5c62070edec461b41.jpg\nAngelcore.jpg\nRipple.jpg\nCherub.jpg\nA029CBE5-D69D-4DFA-85FB-6DE8517DB526.jpeg\n22222222222222222222222222222.jpg\nMmmooonnn.jpg\n62adfe62fe3dcb10fc1d93acc92ef0a2.jpg\nAngel aesthetic.jpeg\nWater.jpg\nAngelcore aesthetic.jpg\nAngels.jpg\nPurity.jpg\nWings.jpg\nAngel wings.jpg\nFlowers in water.jpg\nPure dress.jpg\nThin dress.jpg\nCross.jpg\nAngelp5.jpeg\nAngelp3.png\nAngel-beats-tachibana-kanade-anime-girls-1920x1080-anime-hot-anime-hd-art-wallpaper-thumb.jpeg|tachibana angel beats\nAngel Flowers.jpg\nAngel Pearls.jpg\nRosy Angels.jpg\n2an168ekm6i51.jpg\n403524e4d01fc61764ef584525c0f43f.jpg\nD2ee147e17326af47cfbc250a8a6aff3.jpg\nFgfgdfdmlhhs.jpg\n65fggdsdg.jpg\n2a60dcb93cd6305bbb197d2355c3272d.jpeg\nFile:Angellcoree.jpg\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Core Suffix]]\n[[Category:Visual]]\n[[Category:Fashion]]\n[[Category:Feminine]]\n[[Category:Cute]]"}}}]}}}}
