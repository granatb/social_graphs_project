The style is mainly expressed by women, although men are rarely involved. Female models are also called Cheesecake models, while men are called Beefcake models. \n\n\n\nPin-up models would be photographed in anything from scantily clad clothing to being in the nude. In 1952 actress Marilyn Monroe was asked about her infamous 1949 pin-up photo (included in gallery) and said;<blockquote>''it\u2019s not quite true I had nothing on: I had the radio on.''</blockquote>\n\n== History ==\nAdverts for burlesque shows in the 1800s were the beginning of pin-ups, even though the term wasn't developed until the 1940s. The Gibson Girl style of the late 1800s is also apart of the pin-up past but in a different aspect. \n\nGibson Girls was a style based on Charles Dana Gibson\u2019s art. It\u2019s characterized by Edwardian corsets and Bouffant hair on women who were always keeping up with fashion trends. Unlike burlesque performers, Gibson Girls wouldn't show skin or perform for crowds. They wouldn't cover up in layers of shapeless gowns, preferring to wear close-fitting thin layered dresses to accentuate their curves. They were seen as the epitome of the modern woman; not afraid to go into the workforce, owning their sexuality, and displaying themselves confidently. This was controversial at the time and the public branded the behavior \u201cslutty,\" a word which has no real meaning in and of itself but was historically disparaging. \n\nAn often overlooked part of pin-up history is the Black history facet. Many famous cheesecake models were white, but bombshells like Dorothy Dandridge and Josephine Baker remastered their corners of the pin-up industry in the 1920s and 30s.\n\nAnother artist that greatly contributed to pin-up\u2019s devolvement was Alberto Vargas in the last 1930s. Similar to Gibson, his drawings were called Vargas Girls. They were much more provocative, often appearing completely nude. Although they were more sexual, they were more admired for their natural beauty than their sex appeal.\n\n=== War Times ===\n[[File:Marilyn Monroe pin-up modeling and art.jpg|thumb|19-year-old Marilyn Monroe's modeling for painter Earl Moran|alt=|left]]When the United States entered World War Two in late 1941, pin-ups became popular to boost drafted troop morale. Models we're seen as more sexual and kinky, often dressing up in military-inspired costumes. \n\nFrom here, pin-up modeling went down two routes; innocent, playful, and suggestive; and naughty and BDSM like. The majority of pin-up modeling in the 1940s were the innocent/playful type (this is often called [[Gamine]]). Pin-up wasn't just photography, as many artists also painted pin-up models, like Earl Moran.\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zo%C3%AB_Mozert Zo\u00eb Mozert] was also a huge part of the early pin-up community. She was a painter who often used herself as a model, equipping cameras and mirrors. She signed an exclusive calendar contract with Brown and Bigelow the same year that the U.S. joined WWII, 1941. \n\nMost famous war-time pin-up models were women like Marilyn Monroe, Rita Hayworth, Betty Grable, Cleo Moore, Jayne Mansfield, etc.\n\n<br />\n\n== Playboy era and Bettie Page's revolution ==\n[[File:Bunny Yeager and Bettie Page.jpg|thumb|Bettie Page (left) and Bunny Yeager (right)]]The magazine Playboy was a quintessential part of pin-up culture. It was founded by Hugh Hefner in 1953, and it's first issue included the 1949 photo of Marilyn Monroe by Tom Kelley. The magazine introduced the more kinky and BDSM side of pin-ups, with the rise of Bettie Page's fame. Page was one of Playboy's first playmates, which gave way to her fame. <blockquote>Hefner described Page as \"a combination of wholesome innocence and fetish-oriented poses that is at once retro and very modern.\".</blockquote>As her fame grew, so did her independence and public sexuality. In the 50s she started modeling and acting in fetish films and photos. She appeared in short \"specialty\" films where she acted out fetishes with only other women (important to note; this wasn't considered pornography necessarily, as no one in these films were ever naked). Because of her work in these films, she became known as the \"Queen of Bondage\" and \"The Girl with the Perfect Figure\". She often collaborated with model and photographer Bunny Yeager. Yeager was also a model, but never did pin-up or nudity, unlike Page. \n\nPage became the first famous bondage model. Her short films had themes of abduction, domination, spanking, leather costumes, slave-training, etc. Her acting range was anywhere from Dominatrix to helpless victim. Her work in the BDSM industry introduced conservative 1950s America to sexual exploration. Her impact on the world and specifically the pin-up community is still seen today in celebrities like Katy Perry, Madonna, Beyonc\u00e9, and in the public. \n\n== Visuals ==\n\n* Black and white photography\n* Creams, red, pastels, black\n* Makeup and hair; Full, shaped brows; vibrant red matte lipstick in a \"hunters bow\" shape; water waves hair style; victory rolls; and Bettie bangs\n* Lingere\n* Female nudity\n* Delicate, soft looking women\n*Silhouette figures\n*Cheetah print\n*Tuelle\n*Satin\n*Tattoos on modern day models\n\n== Models ==\n[[File:Jayne Mansfield.jpg|thumb|Jayne Mansfield]]\n\n=== Golden Age of Hollywood (1900 - 1960s) ===\n\n==== Cheesecake Models ====\n\n* Bettie Page\n* Marilyn Monroe\n* Josephine Baker\n*Betty Grable\n*Elvira\n* Kim Novak\n* Ava Gardner\n* Sophia Loren\n* Clara Bow\n* Carole Lombard\n* Brigitte Bardot\n* Lauren Bacall\n* Diana Dors\n* Hedy Lamarr\n*Dorothy Dandridge\n* Rita Hayworth\n* Jayne Mansfield\n* Gina Lollobrigida\n* Cleo Moore\n* Veronica Lake\n* Sandra Dee\n* Jean Harlow\n*Jane Russell\n*Eartha Kitt\n*Betty Boop\n\n==== Beefcake Models ====\n\n* James Dean\n* Jim Morrison\n* Rudolph Valentino\n* Ram\u00f3n Novarro\n* Johnny Weissmuller\n* Buster Crabbe\n* Tony Curtis\n* Rock Hudson\n* Tab Hunter\n* Jeff Chandler\n* Robert Conrad\n* Robert Wagner\n* Elvis Presley\n\n=== Modern Day (1970s+) ===\n\n==== Cheesecake Models ====\n\n*[https://sabinakelley.com/ Sabina Kelley]\n*[https://twitter.com/zombiegogo?lang=en Gogo Blackwater]\n*Cherokee Jackson (AKA thecherrydollface)\n*Claire Sinclair\n*Sarah Marie Summer\n*Dita Von Teese\n*Angelique Noire\n*Natasha Noir\n*Anna Nicole Smith\n*Jessica Rabbit\n\n==== Beefcake Models ====\n\n* Burt Reynolds\n* Nick Kamen\n\n== Pulp Magazines ==\n[[File:Super Science Pulp magazine.jpg|thumb|Pulp Magazine \"Super Science\"]]\n'''Pulp Magazines''' were cheap magazines from the late 1800s to the mid 1900 hundreds. They were also called ''\"pulp fiction\"'' ''\"the pulps\", \"slicks\"'', and ''\"glossies\".'' They were about 130 pages, and contained typical, mediocre fiction. Even though many renowned and respected authors worked on them, they were looked down on. Pulp magazine's featured pin-up art, called ''\"pulp art\".''\n\nThese stories had a variety of genres but almost always had some sort of sexual and exploitative aspect. Some of these genres were:\n\n* Adventure\n* Spicy (soft porn)\n* War\n* Detective/crime\n* Fantasy\n* Horror\n* Romance\n* Science fiction\n* Westerns\n* Super hero\n\n=== Origins ===\nThe first pulp magazine was [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argosy_(magazine) Argosy], from 1896, although it featured no art. In the beginning, they cost a nickel, which gave them the name ''\"dime novels\",'' although this price would later change. Street and Smith was the next big magazine in the pulp industry at the time, and did include art. It's fame skyrocketed when their book Ayesha was made into a series in 1905. It also made the Lost World sub-genre more popular, influencing other pulp writers like Robert E. Howard, Talbot Mundy, Edgar Rice Burroughs, and many others. It's popularity raised the price to \uffe015. This encouraged Street and Smith to begin adding other genres to their magazine like detective, romance, spicy, mix of multiple types (like spicy detective), etc. \n[[File:MAN'S BOOK, 1967.png|left|thumb|209x209px|1967 MAN'S BOOK featuring pin-up model Eva Lynd]]\nBy the 1930s, the most popular pulp magazines were Adventure, Argosy, Short Stories, and Blue Book. These inexpensive magazines became one the major sources of entertainment during the great depression. However, during WWII, paper became more expensive, since most resources were used for the war effort, and pulps became more costly. This made the original appeal of glossies disappear, which began its decline. To combat the paper shortages, many company's switched to digest sizes, which made them more compact and small. The popularity of comics, televisions, and paperbacks also negatively impacted their deterioration. By the 1950s, the ''\"Men's Adventure\"'' magazine's took pulps place. These magazines also featured pin-up art.\n\n=== Men's Adventure ===\n[[File:Eric stanton, 1950.jpg|thumb|170x170px|Eric Stanton's dominatrix painting, \"Girls' Night\", 1950]]\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Men%27s_adventure Men's adventure magazines] took pulp magazines place in the late 1940s up until the 1970s. They were also called ''\"armpit slicks\", \"the sweats\", or \"men's sweat magazines\"''. As the name suggest, these magazines were directed towards a male audience with stories of wartime adventures and enticing travels featuring pin-up girls. Pulp magazines like Argosy and Adventure eventually switched to sweat magazines. Other magazines popped up in the Men's Adventure genre like ''\"Swank\", \"World of Men\", \"Cavalier\"'', ''\"Man's Epic\"'', and ''\"Stag\"''. Because of World War Two, Nazi's and Communist's often took the villain role. \n\nThey almost always featured the trope of damsels in distress. The introduction of sexually-deviant behavior was likely influenced by Bettie Page's S&M films and photography. Books featuring women in peril almost always shows women exploited and in bondage. Occasionally though, it showed women in power and dominance. These [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominatrix dominatrix] characters would dominate men as well as women, or even both. \n\n== Artists and Photographers ==\n[[File:Milo Manara.jpg|thumb|Art by Milo Manara]]\n\n=== Artists ===\n\n* Earl Moran \n* Alberto Vargas\n* Olivia De Berarinis\n* Luma Rouge\n* Fiona Stephenson\n\n* Zo\u00eb Mozert\n\n* Joyce Ballentyne\n* Irene Patten\n* Laurette Patten\n* Ruth Deckard\n* Arnold Armitage\n* Rolf Armstrong\n* Aslan\n* McClelland Barclay\n* Vaughan Bass\n* Edwin Georgi\n* Paul Rader\n* Milo Manara\n\n=== Photographers ===\n\n* Bunny Yeager\n* Tom Kelley\n* Bruno Bernard\n* John Willie\n* Andre De Dienes\n* Peter Gowland\n* Frank Powolny\n\n== Media ==\n\n=== Movies and TV shows ===\n\n* The Notorious Bettie Page (2005)\n* The Seven Year Itch (1955)\n* PinUp Girl (1944)\n* Gilda (1946)\n* Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (1953)\n* Hollywoodland (2006)\n* Calendar Girl Murders (1984)\n* Pin Up!
