This aesthetic centers heavily on music.\n\nOverall, electro swing is to do with partying and having a good time. It often gives off an atmosphere of positivity and joy.\n\nElectro swing music is often remixed from the 1920s - 50s, which can cause the aesthetic to fall into the trope of romanticizing that era. It is especially important to remember that and appreciate that swing music is a form of Jazz, meaning many, if not most or all elements of swing are inspired by Black culture.\n\n== Music ==\nMusic is central to electro swing.
