It tends to borrow heavily from [[Animecore]] (especially more feminine animes like Sailor Moon and Fruits Basket), [[Scene]], and [[Old Web]] (while also taking some fashion cues from the [[McBling]] aesthetic that this was inspired by). Its aesthetic is centered around the preadolescent period of the ages of 10 to 14, so while there is certainly a lot of pink involved (like you'd expect from Kidcore for girls), it's a slightly refined usage of the color pink. There's also an emphasis on Disney Show sitcoms like Hannah Montana and Disney princesses as well.\n\n\n\n<br />\n== Visuals ==\nTweencore aesthetics involve lots of pinks and purples, pretty anime girls, old internet messengers from a bygone era (especially MSN Messanger and AIM), Disney princesses, and a developing rebellious spirit. One may also see Boy Band/Pop Princess/teen idol images pop up in the Tweencore aesthetic as well.\n\n== Fashion ==\nTweencore fashion involves lots of miniskirts, tank tops, babydoll-style shirts, sneakers, socks, and involves pinks and purples. The more feminine styles had flower, rainbow, and heart graphics and patterns. Less girly tweens wore [[Scene]] influenced outfits, which combined bright colors with black.\n\n<br />\n\n=== Brands ===\n\n* Abercrombie and Fitch/Abercrombie Kids\n* Aeropostale/P.S. from Aeropostale\n* American Apparel\n* American Eagle/77 Kids by American Eagle\n* Delia's\n* Forever 21\n*Gilly Hicks\n* Hollister\n*Justice & Brothers\n*Limited Too\n\n== Music ==\n(Under Construction)\n\n<br />\n\n== Computer Games ==\n\n* The Sims\n\n== Movies ==\n\n* ''Clueless'' (1995)\n* ''Legally Blonde'' (2001) and ''Legally Blonde 2'' (2003)\n* ''Cadet Kelly'' (2002)\n* ''Get A Clue'' (2002)\n* ''The Lizzie McGuire Movie'' (2003)\n* ''A Cinderella Story'' (2004)\n*''Ella Enchanted'' (2004)\n* ''New York Minute'' (2004)\n* ''Mean Girls'' (2004)\n* ''The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants'' (2005)\n* ''Aquamarine'' (2006)\n*''Flicka'' (2006)\n* ''Just My Luck'' (2006)\n* ''Hairspray'' (2007)\n*''Nancy Drew'' (2007)\n\n== TV Shows ==\n\n* ''Sabrina the Teenage Witch'' (1996-2003)\n* ''Lizzie McGuire'' (2001-2004)\n* ''Winx Club'' (2004-)\n* ''H2O: Just Add Water'' (2006-2010)\n* ''That's So Raven'' (2003-2007)\n* ''The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air'' (1990-1996)\n* ''The Nanny'' (1993-1999)\n* ''SpongeBob Squarepants'' (1999-2021)\n* ''Rugrats'' (1991-2006)\n* ''The Powerpuff Girls'' (1998-2005)\n* ''The Fairly OddParents'' (2001-2017)\n* ''Kim Possible'' (2002-2007)\n* ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' (1997-2003)\n\n== Resources ==\nExternal links to help get a better understanding of this aesthetic.\n\n=== Pinterest Boards ===\n\n* https://www.pinterest.com/stuffedanimallover2006/tweencore/\n* https://www.pinterest.com/aestheticsthemes/tweencore-aesthetic/\n* https://www.pinterest.com/mehrkiana/tweencore/\n* https://www.pinterest.com/nini04ni/tweencore/\n* https://www.pinterest.com/h0pewurld_/tweencore-band/\n* https://www.pinterest.com/2003kiid/tweencore/\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"130\">\nTumblr lv3mkjpUsC1qebijpo1 500.png|While the characters themselves aren't tweens, the Fashion Club from Daria definitely has the Tweencore aesthetic down.\nTumblr p14n53ZIXr1wl8b14o1 400.gif\nTweencore1.jpeg\nTweencore2.jpeg\nTweencore3.jpeg\nTweencore4.jpeg\nTweencore5.jpeg\nTweencore6.jpeg\nTweencore7.jpeg\nTweencore8.jpeg\nTweencore9.jpeg\nTweencore10.jpeg\nFile:Sisterhood of the traveling pants actresses.png\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Core Suffix]]\n[[Category:Visual]]\n[[Category:Fashion]]\n[[Category:Needs work]]"}}}]}}}}
