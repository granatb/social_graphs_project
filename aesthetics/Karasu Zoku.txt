While similar fashion trends are still around, the term is no longer used due to the base association with violent gangs around the height of its popularity.\n\n\n\n== History ==\nRei Kawakubo and Yohji Yamamoto presented their works at the Paris Collection in the spring and summer of 1982, giving the fashion world a \u201cblack impact\u201d. It was evaluated by current Chanel and Fendi designers Karl Lagerfeld, Jean Paul Gaultier, and Donna Karan, and gradually passed on to the media, entertainers, artists, and the cutting-edge people of the era. In addition, DC brands such as \"Comsade Mode\" and \"Scoop\", which were popular at that time, also promoted black fashion.\n\nNot only Harajuku and Shibuya, but also the adult town of Ginza was crowded with Karasu Zoku.\n\n=== Issues with Nebuta Matsuri ===\nThey enter the festival wearing black costumes instead of the traditional ''haneto'' costumes, leading to the nickname \"crow gang\" or simply, \"crows.\" They're also known as \"crow ''haneto'',\" but their appearance and actions are not fitting of the name ''haneto'', and the regional media does not include the word in their descriptions. They are classified as a type of foot-borne b\u014ds\u014dzoku.\n\nThe ''karasu-zoku'' first appeared at the festival in 1986. Initially, they were not viewed as a serious problem, but they became more dangerous when b\u014ds\u014dzoku members began joining. The Japanese started raising awareness about this issue, but it only made Karasu Zoku more popular.\n\nAomori City quickly took steps to ensure the safety of their festival, as it was a well known tourist attraction. In 1996, the organizers forcefully grouped the ''karasu-zoku'' together into a single area in order to monitor their actions more effectively. However, this only led to an increased level of hysteria among the gang members and was not an effective method of containing their behavior. The number of Crow Gang increased to over 10,000 by 2000, and their actions escalated to violence against different gang members or even against tourists and the police force, which destroyed the festival cheer and decreased public safety.\n\nIn 2001, the organizers introduced a system where all of the floats would begin and end their procession at the same time. The same year, the prefecture enacted a law that allowed the police force to act against the vandals before the violence began. As a result, the festivities became more contained, but the number of crow gang members decreased drastically.\n== Visuals ==\nKarasu Zoku consists of covering the whole body in only black. It was also popular to wear it in a heavy layered style by combining long lengths and tattered details. The name comes from the appearance of a group of black crows. The style is androgynous, asymmetrical, and utterly unpredictable in shape[[File:\u30ab\u30e9\u30b9\u65cf\u30e1\u30a4\u30af&\u304f\u307e\u307f\u304d\u304c\u539f\u5bbf\u7cfb\u306b\u306a\u308b\u307e\u3067 The Karasu-zoku Make-up & How Kumamiki Became a Harajuku Girl|right|thumb|150x150px]]\n\n*Deep V-necks\n* Long, saggy skirts\n* Wrinkled fabrics\n* Slashed sleeves\n* Belts\n* Scarves\n* Collared capes\n* Bustled skirts\n* Heavy pants\n* Turtlenecks\n* Choppy haircuts\n\n== Fashion ==\nNot only black-based designer brands, but also DC brands, which are casual and easy to wear trends, were also popular.\n\n'''Popular Brands:'''\n\n* Comme des Gar\u00e7ons\n* Yohji Yamamoto\n*Issey Miyake\n*Yves Saint Laurent\n*Dior Homme \n*Saint Laurent Paris\n* Comme Ca Du Mode\n* Scoop\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery orientation=\"none\" widths=\"185\">\nAll Black in a new trend.jpg\nAll Black Harajuku Minimalist.jpg\nBy Gracia Ventus.jpg\n14AW COLLECTION +NOIR.jpg\nYohji Yamamoto.jpg\nLow Classic.jpg\nD\u00e9fil\u00e9_Yohji_Yamamoto_Automne-hiver_2016-2017_Pr\u00eat-\u00e0-porter.jpg\n\u5199\u771f20_24\uff5c\u30d3\u30fc_\u30e8\u30a6\u30b8\u30e4\u30de\u30e2\u30c8(B_Yohji_Yamamoto)_2018\u5e74\u6625\u590f_\u30a6\u30a3\u30e1\u30f3\u30ba_\u30b3\u30ec\u30af\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3.jpg\nCrow tribe.jpg\nBEAMS\uff08\u30d3\u30fc\u30e0\u30b9\uff09\u516c\u5f0f\u30b5\u30a4\u30c8.jpg\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Fashion]]\n[[Category:Visual]]\n[[Category:Japanese]]"}}}]}}}}
