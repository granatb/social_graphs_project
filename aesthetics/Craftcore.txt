The most popular craftcore visual and activity is embroidery, but the aesthetic encompasses a variety of other craft activities and crafted items.\n\n\n\n== History ==\nCrafts have existed for a long time. However, the word \"Craftcore\" hasn't been used for this aesthetic until the late 2010s.\n\nIn a society where most products are made by machines and robots, appreciating crafts and the craftsmanship that goes into it is something that has become lost on many members of society. Luckily, many people are still enjoying making and buying handmade items. Just like [[Cottagecore]], Craftcore may be seen as an aesthetic that longs for simplicity and self-sustainability. However, Craftcore is not anti-tech. Using the newest tools for crafts is not looked down upon.\n\n== Fashion ==\nCraftcore does not have a clear fashion guideline (it is very versatile and easy to combine with other aesthetics), although the following do fit the Craftcore aesthetic:\n* (Self-)knitted sweaters\n*Anything you've made yourself\n* Thrifted clothing items that have been personalized by tailoring and/or embroidery\n* Overalls that can hold all/most of your tools\n* Pencil behind your ear\n* Embroidering clothes you already have (most commonly insects (bees, butterflies, ladybugs), flowers/plants, stars/planets, animals (hedgehogs, deer, birds, foxes, cats, dogs), mushrooms, fruit, but also gaming and fandom-related patterns)\n* Sturdy boots\n* Crocheted hats with flowers on them\n* Clothes that you added pockets onto\n* Aprons\n* Patchwork clothes (like jackets)\n* Handpainted denim\n*A totebag or satchel to hold your supplies\n*Ribbons or hair ties (to keep your hair out of your face while you're working)\n\n== Hobbies ==\nCraftcore is centered around hobbies and activities. \n* Tie-dying\n* Making your own jam jar fabric covers\n* Needlefelting/Knitting/Crocheting your own plushies\n* Crafting a organizer out of cardboard\n* Sewing everyday items\n* Pottery\n* woodworking\n* Cooking\n*Cross stitching\n*Bedazzling and painting everything\n*candle making \n*Soap making\n*Making clothes\n*Photography\n*Drawing and sketching\n*Making jewellery\n\n(Note: the point of Craftcore is not to \"do as many crafts as you can\", but it is about loving and appreciating handmade items, whether that is via one craft or more.\u00a0 Remember; quality over quantity.)\n\nCraftcore does not have to be expensive. Even though professional tools (such as a good sewing machine) are expensive, you can act this aesthetic out by, for example, just buying embroidery needles ($3-6) and yarn ($4-8) (maybe also embroidery hoops ($10-20)) to start embroidering your clothes.\n\n== Resources ==\nExternal links to help get a better understanding of this aesthetic.\n\n* [https://diyjoy.com/ DIY Joy]\n* [https://www.diynetwork.com/ DIY Network]\n\n=== Articles ===\n\n* [https://www.housebeautiful.com/home-remodeling/diy-projects/how-to/g1624/diy-solutions-easier-life/ DIY Solutions for Easier Life | House Beautiful]\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery navigation=\"true\" widths=\"135\">\nScandireader.jpg|Strawberry flower pot by scandireader on Tumblr|link=https://scandireader.tumblr.com/post/614029484090408960/i-made-som-strawberry-flower-pots\nQuartzbound.jpg|Book by Quartzbound on Tumblr (linked is their tutorial!)|link=https://quartzbound.tumblr.com/post/155380287074/kats-bookbinding-tutorial-posted-ive-finished\nHooodie-weather.jpg|Handpainted (animal crossing themed) pants by hooodie-weather on Tumblr|link=https://hooodie-weather.tumblr.com/post/618580281097666560/hand-painted-some-animal-crossing-themed-jeans\nBerriesandbonnets.jpg|Crotchet lemon bag by berriesandbonnets on Tumblr|link=https://berriesandbonnets.tumblr.com/post/617916504303910912/a-cute-small-crochet-lemon-bag-now-in-my\nAlisonsmouth.jpg|Embroidered overalls by alisonsmouth on Tumblr|link=https://alisonsmouth.tumblr.com/post/617922463464144896/cottagecore-dungaree-made-by-me\nXyrion-kyrei.jpg|Embroidered shirt by xyrion-kyrel on Tumblr|link=https://xyrion-kyrel.tumblr.com/post/190965303976/hand-embroidered-froggy-shirt\nHh((.jpeg\nBee jeans.jpg\nProcess-photos----2 f24d732b-a55b-43b6-ba7a-82e7ad5c613f.jpg\n887eff4b598fd75ccfd6156ba4d7cd08.jpg\nCe324c25a094f3cb842c67eaaaa81447.jpg\nTips-for-finding-pottery-inspiration-e1536174616517.jpeg\nBf783f274210295f3ae8e772a216b619.jpg\nF5e836bf98a149aebf1e.jpg\nSPLATTERPAINT.jpg\n6a00e55210ddf588340133ed97e53e970b.jpg\nD3907d3cac3903baff68eeb435c6a231.jpg\n51J-BU6i2tL.
