This can lead to lots of crossovers with [[Cartelcore]] or even certain kinds of [[Synthwave]] visuals that cross over into the Tropical aesthetic (so lots of the 80's style sunsets and palm trees can pair really well into the Miami Metro aesthetic.  Exotic sports cars, beautiful women, and South Beach's rich night life can also play very prominent roles in Miami Metro visual aesthetics.\n\n== Fashion ==\nMiami Metro is defined by its casual sophistication.\n\nClothing elements that can be associated with Miami Metro include but are not limited to \n\n* Blazers\n* Ray-Bans\n* Hawaiian Shirts\n* Salty Hair\n* Boots\n* Cardigans\n* Glasses\n* Flowers\n*Jeans\n\n== Activities ==\nSome activities popular in Miami Vice can include getting into a sports car and driving down Biscayne Boulevard, taking part in Miami's rich night life and food culture, and just generally enjoying the beach life of Miami.  If you're part of some particularly shady circles of Miami, however, some of these activities could be considered [[Drugcore|less than legal and probably not advisable to take part in]].\n\n== Media ==\nThe show that best exemplifies some retro Miami Metro aesthetics is the famous 80's TV show ''Miami Vice'' and the video games ''Grand Theft Auto: Vice City'' and ''Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories''.  Some songs that can fit the Miami Metro aesthetic include \"Miami\" by Will Smith and \"Miami Nights\" by Synthwave artist Trevor Something, as well as lots of 80s New Wave tracks.\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\n\nFile:Miami-south-beach-hotels-south-beach-miami-florida-usa main.jpg|An example of Miami Metro visuals\n\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Fashion]]"}}}]}}}}
