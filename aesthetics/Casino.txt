From there the aesthetics diverges into two different kinds of Casino: High Roller and Tourist.\n\nHigh Roller Casino will generally carry more of an air of opulence and elegance, touching into [[Boujee]] territory.\n\nTourist Casino, meanwhile, has more of a relaxed, playful, and fun atmosphere to it.  It's nothing serious, just going out and having some [[Cleancore|clean]], adult fun. Tourist Casino notes that, while it would be nice to strike it big, it's ultimately just about the fun and not getting overboard with gambling away all of your money.\n\n== Fashion ==\nHigh Roller Casino fashion includes formalwear and can share a lot in common with the [[Lounge]] aesthetic. High Roller Casino individuals tend to hang around the table games (Poker, Roulette, Blackjack, etc)\n\nTourist Casino fashion tends to be a bit more lax (simple t-shirts and what not) and shares a lot in common with [[Vacation Dadcore]], with added fanny pack for fun effect.  Tourist Casino individuals will tend to hang around the Slot machines and other games of that nature.\n\n== Inspirations ==\n\n=== Film and television ===\n\n*''Oceans 11''\n*''Oceans 12''\n*''Oceans 13''\n*One Eyed Jack's from ''Twin Peaks''\n*''Money Plane''\n\n=== Anime/Manga ===\n\n*''Kakegurui''\n*''Kaiji''\n\n<br />\n== Music ==\n\n=== Spotify Playlist ===\n\n* [https://open.spotify.com/user/rperrings/playlist/7d4KnA7csmRyDJoaZ7dVKz Casino Music playlist by rperrings]\n* [https://open.spotify.com/user/itsemeryk/playlist/4LD7rVlSZevrCCjd4u2PWI Casino Playlist playlist by itsemeryk]\n* [https://open.spotify.com/user/loesc033/playlist/7FJ5yarckSPshvmaP4ywBI Casino Night Playlist playlist by Nathan Loesch]\n* [https://open.spotify.com/user/huitematjes/playlist/5yu1Yjapj9LfuPuzNP8IhV Casino Jazz playlist by Pascal Huitema]\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery orientation=\"none\" widths=\"135\" bordercolor=\"#000000\">\nSlot-Machines.jpg\n60301b91e22b15295800e5d85fe83445.jpg\nTumblr c89d0644d436c9353b2aba5a4b0c4e0e 4c8fe318 640.jpg\n6579fcca201efe95afa7a946d6ef3350.jpg\n6306473290 495d4a13f3 b.jpg\nThe Weeknd - Blinding Lights\nCasino.jpeg\nVIP-Chips.jpg\nBetting.jpg\nGoldcards.jpg\nCasino outfit.png\nCASINO.jpg\nDice.jpg\nCards.jpg\nRed casino aesthetic.jpg\nAce card.jpg\nCards and coins.jpg\nCards plie.jpeg\n7986a0775afd28821caef9969a2c95ab.jpg|kakegurui\nFirekeepersjpg-eb22b963c052381e.jpg\nTumblr_6ec627bc12e117db720441aa45ae6935_c04f300f_640.png\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Visual]]\n[[Category:Fashion]]\n[[Category:Music]]\n[[Category:Vacation, amusement, and recreation]]"}}}]}}}}
