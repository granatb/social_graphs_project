This subtype of [[:Category:Academia|Academia]] promotes the acceptance of messy or seemingly uncomposed traits some students may have.\n\n==Intentions==\nChaotic Academia can be defined as:\n\n*An academia movement that welcomes the disconnection between appearance and personality. The aim is to normalise and humanise the academic aesthetic and reclaim it from the elitism of days gone by.\n*This aesthetic intends to focus on the process of learning instead of stressing over looks and trying to perfect one's secondary aspects, like fashion.\n*Chaotic Academia acknowledges the pretentiousness of classic academia, subtly mocking it at times. Nevertheless, as an academic subculture, it participates in it as well. Chaotic academics know this, and embrace it.\n\n<br />\n\n== History ==\nChaotic Academia originated with the text post from tumblr user chiafett-main saying, \"Chaotic academia is 1.) Intense obsessions that last maybe two weeks but consume your soul 2.) Spacing out in class but loving to learn 3.) Swearing and slang while discussing deep academic topics\".<ref>http://web.archive.org/web/20210527083318/https://chiafett-main.tumblr.com/post/187985924082/chaotic-academia-is-1-intense-obsessions-that</ref> This was posted on September 27, 2019, at the same time as the popularization of Dark Academia and the aesthetic variations being built off of this, such as with [[Light Academia|Light Academia.]]\n\n==Visual==\nThe idea is to accept and stop judging the less visually pleasing or perfectly performed tasks and processes. Unlike some other genres, it doesn't inherently agree to follow the rules and implies some visual or behavioral variety from the all-accepted idea of the prim and proper academics. Be yourself, have fun, and enjoy studying. For some, the floor is the best place to study, people can lack time management, scrawl poetry on a napkin, and not in a notebook, use vandalism for help on an exam, and have anarchism quotes all over notes. And it's fine!\n\n==Inspirations ==\n===Books===\nChaotic academia books fall under 2 categories: banned literature, and books that weren't banned but are still chaotic (in a good way) in their own right. For instance, Ella Minnow Pea wasn't widely banned, but as the book goes along, the author stops using certain letters of the alphabet.\n\n==== Banned literature, listed by book name in alphabetical order: ====\n\n*Anything written by Oscar Wilde\n*Anything written by Dan Brown\n*Anything written by Edgar Allan Poe\n*Anything written by Douglas Adams\n*Anything written by Sylvia Plath\n*''Animal Farm'' by George Orwell\n*''Brave New World'' by Aldous Huxley\n*''Carry On'' by Rainbow Rowell\n*''Doctor Zhivago'' by Boris Pasternak\n*''Dracula'' by Bram Stoker\n* The ''Harry Potter'' series by J.K.

Some activities it's associated with are:\n\n*Performing rituals in class with books and other things\n*Spending days on the grounds of the school\n*Handing in homework at the last minute\n*School uniforms getting torn or being dirty\n*Food fights\n*Study parties at 1 am\n* Sneaking out of school or skipping class\n*Reciting useless facts\n* Drinking cold tea\n* Reading banned books\n*Leaving annotations in the margins of library books (bonus points if they're memes)\n*Always losing your pens\n*Covering your bedroom wall in sticky notes\n* Discussing conspiracies about Shakespeare with your friends\n*Collecting foreign books that are in a language you don't understand\n* Intense and quick obsessions that consume your soul (and ranting to your friends about them 24/7)\n*Spacing out in class\n* Drinking tea or coffee from shot glasses or drinking liquor from teacups\n*Swearing and slang while discussing deep academic topics\n*Emptying your pockets at the end of the day and coming to a total of four pens, a pocket notebook, two receipts, and a highlighter\n*Using a rubber band to tie your hair back\n*Taking a \"quick break\", then waking up in the middle of the night\n*Drinking energy drinks from vintage teacups\n* Stealing school property, although this is discouraged\n*Going out during a break in the rain deliberately to get wet\n*Putting your feet up on the desk while you think with your pen behind your ear\n*Sneaking into the library after hours to \"borrow\" restricted fiction\n* Standing on desks\n*Writing too many unorganized and uncoordinated annotations\n*Aggressively mouthing lyrics to blaring music while studying\n*Fidgeting around with supplies\n*Scattering papers across the desk or floor\n*Choosing to train home alone when friends were easily accessible \n*Sleeping late every night due to neverending thoughts\n\n==Fashion==\nThe style doesn't have to be strictly formal and proper. The uniform should be fun! You can mess with a shirt a little, altering it to one's liking, and cut and fix it in different places. Convenience and comfort are a priority. Anything school-related or quick and easy will do. Be yourself!\n\nSome of these examples are:\n\n*Button downs open over logo tee shirts\n*Messy eyeliner\n*Heavy boots\n*Mismatched socks\n*The same hoodie or sweater every day\n*Patched or torn clothes\n*Too many cardigans and sweaters\n*School uniform but worn incorrectly; neckties around heads, ripped stockings\n*Large blazers\n*Sandals or crocs (when you\u2019re too lazy to put on boots)\n*Jeans\n*Untied laces\n*Leg warmers\n*Oversized Earth tone Sweaters\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"130\">\nOriginal-2.jpg\nChaotic Academia-0.png\nChaotic Academia.png\nF6b002303b14f28cb86ea52861355a17.jpg\nDrawing with chalk.jpg\nBrushes in a bag.jpg\n@justinhulme.jpg\nStudying time.jpg\nBook pile.jpg\nBathroom graffiti.jpg\nDorm.jpg\nRunning students.png\nChasing.png\nCool fit.jpg\n4fe86e8e5900fec857d36da3ce486559.jpg\nChaos.jpg\nChaotic academia1.jpg\nBest Punk Movies - Cult Classics - Repo Man.png\nChaotic academia class.jpg\nChaotic academia book.jpg\nChaotic academia 3.jpg\nChaotic academia cart.jpg\nChaotic academia5.jpg\nChaotic academia coffee.jpg\nChaotic academia notes.jpg\nChaotic academia2.jpg\nRARARARARARRA.png\nBook window.jpg\nBooks..jpg\nWall..jpg\nThe end.jpg\nMessy.jpg\nFrench-girl-style IMG 8743.jpg\nFile:Dark academia aesthetic.jpeg\nFile:Dark academia aesthetic 5.jpeg\nFile:Dark academia aesthetic 4.jpeg\nFile:Dark academia aesthetic 3.jpeg\nFile:Dark academia aesthetic 1.jpeg\nFile:Dark academia aesthetic 2.jpeg\nFile:Dark academia aesthetic 6.jpeg\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Academia]]\n[[Category:Visual]]\n[[Category:Music]]\n[[Category:Fashion]]\n[[Category:Written]]"}}}]}}}}
