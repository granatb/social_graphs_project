It falls into two categories: [[Peach#Modern Peach|Modern Peach]], which refers to the present by using more minimalist and simplified forms, often with a combination of pink and white, and [[Peach#Vintage Peach|Vintage Peach]], which is associated with the past, pays great attention to nostalgia and appreciation of various art forms of the time, especially to the music and the fancy looks.\n\n==Modern Peach==\n{{Aesthetic\n|title1             = Modern Peach\n|other_names        = Peachy, Peachcore\n|related_aesthetics = [[Kawaii]]<br>[[Lo-Fi]]\n|image1=\u0437\u0430\u0433\u0440\u0443\u0436\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0435.jpg\n|caption1           =\n|key_motifs         =\n|key_colours        = Warm toned pink and orange, soft yellow, green, white\n|key_values         = \n|related_media      = \n|related_brands     = }}\n\nThe '''Modern Peach''' aesthetic can be characterized by an emphasis on the beauty of modern life and the use of various peach-related sweets or any other goods to emphasize the cute and soul-warming things that can be noticed in one's daily routine.\n\n===Visual===\nModern Peach uses cities, social and artistic activities as a way of showing gratitude for the pleasant things that current events can offer. Going to the mall with friends, painting peaches, learning more fruit-based recipes, and doing one's best to help others are some of the possible activities that can be performed. \n\n===Fashion===\nOutfits this style consists of are usually quite simple and convenient, without too much lace or embroidery.

Unlike the other, more modern counterpart, '''Vintage Peach''' is characterized by a certain elegance in the composition and choice of clothing.\n\n===Visual===\nVintage Peach uses nature, social, and countryside activities as a way of reliving the best, happiest parts of the past. Picnics, book evenings in the orchards, long bike rides on a hot summer day, fruit picking with friends, going to a local market, and having a long bath with peach candles are all related. Tranquility in this instance can be shown through non-modernized activities.\n\n===Fashion===\nThe outfits can be considered modest by today's standards, often inspired by trends of the 1920-50s. Popular items are: \n\n* Blouses\n*Cardigans\n* Dresses\n**Shift dresses\n**Baby doll dresses\n**Sack dresses\n**Sheath dresses\n**Shirt waister dresses\n*Fur or silk scarves\n* Handbags\n*Knickerbockers\n*Letterman sweaters\n*Long coats\n*Oxford Bags\n*Pantyhoses\n*Pencil skirts\n*Sacque suits\n*Shawls\n*Straight-legged and wide-legged trousers\n*Turn-ups\n* Vests\n\n===Music===\nThe music has a very calming feel and is quite slow. The point is to make you feel relaxed and nostalgic.\n\n====Spotify Playlists====\n\n* [https://open.spotify.com/playlist/438A2DHNxXNWAp3pzE2PKs?si=4PDBHUQMSmOt3AxmEQNCFw '''vintage romance songs''' Spotify playlist by ninaruet]\n* [https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1TtH5WgH3swacn60JCe0ZS '''autumn vintage romance''' Spotify playlist by louise batulayan :))]\n\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0jgRaDJW6uXJlyPqoiOIQz?si=KPkhbqU7S62IQFAhk2DVlw '''vintage peaches \ud83c\udf51''' Spotify playlist by Grapesoda]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2ZAUR25iuA4kG3PClUT5v3 '''Une Chanson Douce''' Spotify playlist by rhodecamps]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0oIHQKkXaQfATpGR3V60bE '''For a classy elegant old soul ofa lil southern sweethart ;)''' Spotify playlist by savannah cozzens]\n\n<br />\n\n=== Pinterest Boards ===\n\n* [https://br.pinterest.com/silverz_/aesthetic/pinkish/ Aesthetic \u2666\ufe0e Pinkish \u2666\ufe0e by Silverz]\n* [https://br.pinterest.com/silverz_/collage-wallpaper/pink/ Collage Wallpaper \ud83d\udc97Pink\ud83d\udc97 by Silverz]\n* [https://br.pinterest.com/silverz_/collage-wallpaper/orange/ Collage Wallpaper \ud83e\udde1Orange\ud83e\udde1 by Silverz]\n\n===Gallery===\n<gallery orientation=\"square\" widths=\"130\" spacing=\"small\">\n+ c u l t o f \u028d o \u0279 \u0279 o \u026f o \u0287 +.jpg\nBy my life is a joke.jpg\nSome cute things i bought at a garage sale.jpg\n3393af6e-67c3-469f-9e47-bb0e988770e2.jpg\nBy Cristina Saavedra.jpg\n\u02d6\u06ea\u0e30\u02db\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc61\u210e\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc50 \uaa86.jpg\nPls dont del captions.jpg\n\ud83c\udf51JIMIN BOTTOM\ud83c\udf51 -2.jpg\nFruit Aesthetic.jpg\n\u2661 \u2026 \u203a matchabun \u21b7.jpg\nLots of fruit.jpg\nVintage Peach Ruffled Taffeta Dress.png\nE920b481-6452-4bec-90cc-664d5578b905.jpg\nR o s i e (1).jpg\nR o s i e.jpg\nVintage peach.jpg\nPeachy Vintage Car.jpeg\nPeachy Vintage.jpeg\nPeachy Vintage Pink Camera with Flowers.jpeg\n</gallery><br />\n[[Category:Visual]]\n[[Category:Fashion]]\n[[Category:Music]]\n[[Category:Feminine]]\n[[Category:Cute]]"}}}]}}}}
