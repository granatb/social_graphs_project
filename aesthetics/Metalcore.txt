Among other styles blending metal and hardcore, such as\u00a0crust punk\u00a0and\u00a0grindcore, metalcore is noted for its use of\u00a0breakdowns, which are slow, intense passages conducive to\u00a0moshing. The first bands to make music in this style was Integrity and the New York Hardcore bands in the late 1980s alongside the birth of crossover Thrash. \n\nOther defining instrumentation includes heavy\u00a0guitar riffs, occasional\u00a0blast beats, and\u00a0double bass drumming. Vocalists in the genre typically perform yelling or\u00a0screaming. Some later metalcore bands often combine this with the use of clean singing, with the singing often happening during the chorus of the song.\u00a0Death growls\u00a0and gang vocals also are somewhat common types of vocals in metalcore.\n\n== Fashion ==\nIn majority the Metalcore fashion choices come from casual wear such as skinny denim pants, band T-shirts, and skater shoes. Band shirts have various art styles, the early metalcore bands had artwork influenced by New York Hardcore, Youth Crew, urban street, and dark crusty styles. The mid 2000s to present had some bands t-shirt artwork with neon monsters and colorful gorey logos and graphics. The mid 2010s brought another change to Metalcore fashion, with many bands incorporating t-shirt designs with minimalistic designs, often inspired by streetwear fashion\n\n== Visual ==\n''Under Construction''\n\n== Music ==\nEarly bands in the sound style of Metalcore were Integrity and Earth Crisis in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the late 1990s and early 2000s gave rise to bands As I Lay Dying, Hatebreed, Unearth, and Throwdown.\n\n== Subgenres ==\n\n====Melodic Metalcore====\n'''Melodic metalcore'''\u00a0is a fusion genre, incorporating elements of\u00a0[https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Melodic_Death_Metal melodic death metal]\u00a0and\u00a0[https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Metalcore metalcore], with a heavy emphasis on melodic instrumentation, distorted guitar tones,\u00a0palm muting, double bass drumming,\u00a0blast beats, metalcore-stylized\u00a0breakdowns, aggressive\u00a0screaming,\u00a0death growls, and clean\u00a0singing. Many bands in this style took influences from Swedish melodic death metal band At The Gates and combined it with the influences of 90s hardcore.\n\n====Deathcore====\n'''Deathcore''' is a fusion genre combining Brutal or Slam Death Metal, a minor influence from grindcore, blended in with Metalcore. This style focuses a heavy emphasis on the brutal vocals implementing the guttural death growls, screams, and \"pig squeals\" (that sound like a \"demonic pig going 'weeet-wwwweeeettt!\"). The instrumental structures emphasizes more on the rhythmic grooves and heavy breakdowns while maintaining most of the structures used stylistically in Metalcore: \ndistorted guitar tones, palm muting, double bass drumming with blast beats. Bands like Through The Eyes Of The Dead and Suicide Silence were the most prominent examples from the mid 2000s.\n\n== Gallery ==\n''Under Construction''[[Category:Music]]\n[[Category:Core Suffix]]\n[[Category:Fashion]]\n[[Category:Visual]]\n[[Category:Needs work]]\n[[Category:Candidates for Deletion]]"}}}]}}}}
