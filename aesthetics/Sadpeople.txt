Within the Sadpeople group, there are Sadbois and Sadgirls.  Sadpeople often feel lost either mentally or physically. It has some relation to [[Traumacore]], but Traumacore deals with far deeper issues. The Sadpeople aesthetic involves mental space, loneliness, and abandonment. \n==Visual==\nUnlike Traumacore, the Sadpeople aesthetic tends to focus more on feelings of isolation, loneliness, and anxiety that don't necessarily come from CSA or some form of PTSD and distinctly lacks the child-like nature Traumacore tends to have.  However, it can be a popular partner with a [[Liminal Space]] aesthetic to show off that loneliness the Sadpeople aesthetic is associated with as well as a sense of dread.\n==Fashion==\n===Sadbois===\nSadbois don't usually come with a specific style of clothes but they usually dress anywhere from [[Normcore]] to [[Grunge]].\n===Sadgirls===\nSadgirls don't usually come with a specific style of clothes but they usually dress anywhere from [[Grunge]]. There is also an element of the [[E-Girl]] aesthetic that can apply to Sadgirls, but the mentality that Sadgirls have makes the fashions hit different compared to their E-Girl counterparts.\n==Music==\n'''Sadcore''' is a subgenre of music that is an example of alternative rock characterized by bleak lyrics, downbeat melodies and slower tempos, or alternatively, songs with deceivingly upbeat melodies that are \nsimultaneously characterized by depressive lyrical undertones or imagery. Also, the music is sometimes played over degraded Bart Simpson edits.\n\n===Sadpeople Artists===\n\n*[https://open.spotify.com/artist/7gzXeFUDWz0aqhikdkOJxQ Crywank]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/artist/0pg0Zm8FsGAYy5kdHuBnSo Salvia Plath]\n*Halsey\n*Joji\n* Billie Eilish\n*XXXtentacion\n*Juice WRLD\n*Aakon Keetreh\n*$uicideboy$\n\n=== Sadboi Spotify Playlists===\n\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6mrtZGmzDoAJt6C81NOhkB?si=-sHy49vETu6aTrzrN17tfQ sad bois jams for sadbois Spotify playlist by yooliam]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3mlNFFHhKsoBwySvHhhEa8?si=B80Zv4CkTA-JGkUZuZZwbQ Sadbois Playlist Spotify playlist by pattycakearoo]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0K0AHzLww60wbEmRxBIb9D?si=4Pds3R0HQfyKvGfX8Rl6qQ Sadbois and 4lokos Spotify playlist by uwuandchill]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2bZ0OArtTAWUn2ltWF4qmk?si=AQQeO-lYQAuT4h21HF5Q7g SadBoiShit Spotify playlist by s0ftskelet0ns]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/148RC0O0LozonTTf8oKbZJ?si=kyteDzLqQLi7N3n6Iy2wqw Sadbois Spotify playlist by mymmel888]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6isR3IJL1hhXQbT4s0VIIb?si=pQFtOtZuRmiXyejFKFdzmw sadbois Spotify playlist by PapaPraedo]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4cMFrocCUYQxGaFRDxMFjf?si=BM5QpLzVRTOKFiHpKi-aSg sadbois Spotify playlist by Sophia Poirier]\n\n===Sadgirl Spotify Playlists===\n\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/01lA65zN0GI5cJrrH6hbSo?si=Lpel1bCgRb-NrtEQHr8EcQ Songs For Sadgirls Spotify playlist by Bella Do\u00f1a]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7EvqUWkAGliatncFCTFDQj?si=pcSZa0w6Q-iRhXvanci_2w Sadgirls Spotify playlist by Hurfatuljannah]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6bSPp0MJeH09GfT0CMmRnK?si=dR9bx1NrSRSCr_KDAkXQVw SadGirlsClub Spotify playlist by 11101337023]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6Ltyb9XINcJjB7MwmfeQtF?si=OtDcBuV2QBOolBc4pd-NUQ SadGirlShit Spotify playlist by karakicks]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/20jBUQth9uD3EmzfAiTosP?si=0StWFAP4TyCqPNBQPXv4MQ sadgirls..\ud83c\udf19 Spotify playlist by Mimi Thuy Thanh Pham]\n\n===General Sadpeople Spotify Playlists===\n\n*[https://open.spotify.com/user/ollithemess/playlist/09taRH1jdI8BFHnsr6XfKB Lostcore playlist by ollithemess]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/user/lostcore/playlist/5W4XMZ2qbhdmuJYALBZGtb LostCore Easy playlist by Riccardo D'Angelo]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/user/meganemiko/playlist/21eySo6BAQPkoorbtpAc4p lostcore playlist by meganemiko]\n\n==Resources==\n\n===Vendors===\n\n*[https://damnagedclothing.com/ Damaged Clothing]\n*[https://digigoth.com/ Digigoth]\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"130\">\nTumblr pq1fyvgSYB1s7eamy 640.jpg\nTumblr pq1fysF9PA1s7eamy 640.jpg\nTumblr pq1fyv1YBX1s7eamy 640.jpg\nTumblr pq1fyuixer1s7eamy 500.gif\nTumblr pq1fytJZBp1s7eamy 500.jpg\nSadtimes14.jpg\nTumblr pq1fywghGb1s7eamy 400.gif\nTumblr pq1fytDykb1s7eamy 500.gif\nSadtimes11.gif\nSadtimes12.jpg\nTumblr pq1fyvX7Yt1s7eamy 500.gif|Sadgirl Realness\nSadtimes15.jpg\nSadtimes16.jpg\nSadtimes17.jpg\nSadtimes18.jpg\nSadtimes19.jpg\nSadtimes20.jpg\nSadtimes21.jpg\nSadtimes24.jpg\nSadtimes25.jpg\nSadtimes26.jpg\nSadtimes27.jpg\nSadtimes9.jpeg\nSadtimes8.jpeg\nSadtimes3.jpeg\nSadtimes7.jpeg\nSadtimes6.jpeg\nSadtimes5.jpeg\nSadtimes4.jpeg\nSad.jpg\nSadtimes29.jpg\n90352316 628638847869154 6290860366653633457 n.jpg\nVent Blog.png|by desnos on tumblr\nHurt child (2).png|by desnos on tumblr\nHurt child (3).png|by desnos on tumblr\nWhite lost.jpg\nHurt child (5).png|by desnos on tumblr\nGrey.jpg\nIMG 2515-1.jpg\nTumblr.png\nScreenshot 2021-01-23 at 5.25.15 PM.png\nScreenshot 2021-01-21 at 12.32.00 PM.png\nScreenshot 2021-01-23 at 5.27.18 PM.png\nScreenshot 2021-01-23 at 5.25.25 PM.png\nScreenshot 2021-01-23 at 5.28.06 PM.png\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Visual]]\n[[Category:Music]]\n[[Category:Fashion]]\n[[Category:Needs work]]\n[[Category:Sensitive Content]]"}}}]}}}}
