Adherents to the Femme Fatale aesthetic try their best to embody the traits of the classic femme fatale archetype, which leads to a lot of crossover with the [[Baddie]] aesthetic, with one of the key differences between the two is the Femme Fatale has an air of mystery and elegance to her, whereas the Baddies adhere to a more \"what you see is what you get\" philosophy.\n\n\n\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Femme Fatale, also referred to as a Vamp, is a stock character that came into prominence with the film noir movie genre and dime novels of the 20th century. The most prominent codifier is Brigid O'Shaughnessy in the most famous film noir, ''The Maltese Falcon (1941),'' in which she uses her beauty as a distraction and murders the protagonist's partner. \n\n== Personality  ==\nAs stated before the Femme Fatale aesthetic embodies the seductive and mysterious traits. A Femme Fatale will avoid giving information about themselves. Keep things like siblings, interests and what your studying is key. Femme Fatales are not the emotional type and tend to keep their emotions, well, mysterious. They normally don't have long relationships but if they do their significant other is a partner in crime.  Their main goal is to entice and use. \n\nFemme Fatales have to be smart. They have be quick witted, which will show their independence factor. Femme Fatales don't need a anyone to be able to thrive, they can do just fine on their own, if not better. \n\nIf a Femme Fatale seduces and then ''kills'' several men, she becomes a '''Black Widow'''. \n\n== Fashion ==\nA femme fatale will be known to wear dark, sexy, and retro clothes, alluding to the 1940s when the persona was codified. Femmes fatales clothes are well-cut and form-fitting. Black is the name of the game for femme fatale fashion. Dark reds, maroon, dark emerald, and dark blue are also commonly seen colors in the femme fatale wardrobe but every look is going to be largely monochromatic, without prints or many varying textures; the key feature in femme fatale fashion is to accessorize with their own figure. A powerful sense of self and a sharp mind are just as important accessories as any dress. Pair your look with high heels, walk in like you're the hottest person in every room, and you're well on your way to embodying the spirit of the femme fatale. Clothes include:\n\n* Silk cocktail dresses\n* A bold red dress\n*Fitted blouses\n* Leather pants\n* The Little Black Dress\n* Fur coats\n*Women's suits, possibly without a shirt layered beneath\n\nFemme Fatales typically have a signature scent, so you will always remember her after she's gone by the notes that suit her best. Musky and seductive scents recall a femme fatale aesthetic, while fruity scents and flowery scents may best be left aside.\n\nFemme Fatales are almost always seen wearing red lipstick in their most iconic looks. Try wearing shades of red lipstick that complement your skin tone, consider using some lip liner and/or gloss if you want to, and check if you need to touch up or reapply a few times throughout the day. Wearing lipstick also provides an excuse to pull out a mirror, which can be useful for situational awareness in discreet circumstances. \n\n=== Vendors ===\n[https://lafemmeennoir.net/ La Femme En Noir] \n\n[https://www.michelinepitt.com/ Micheline Pitt] \n\n== Visuals ==\n[https://www.pinterest.com/ccclibrary/femme-fatale-fashion/ Femme Fatale Fashion] by CCC Library  [https://www.pinterest.com/farhaaaaaa/femme-fatale-aesthetic/ femme fatale aesthetic] by Farha \u2661  [https://www.pinterest.com/emblafant/femme-fatale/\\ Femme Fatale] by emblafant\n\n== Music ==\n\n* [https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1mZDAOOxShlKWJbtPbwMRm?si=v6XY9aFOREabjJi0R2Txfw femme fatale Spotify playlist by judithabels8]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2UdCdNwOnJrI2j95yyf5pI AESTHETICS: villain (femme fatale)] by [https://open.spotify.com/user/bxva13vs6kb2ts34x5joj4x71?si=f9b4c683a1144a13 Chaotic Good] \n* [https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0O0fS0ct6Y4Srp2uexKwA6?si=MNDtqwa2TFKwuAoNokuHRA Femme Fatale Queer Spotify playlist by vampire_mahou_shoujo]\n* [https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5o02fPaU0XfgOjq7i7XKv9?si=f0aGCDdRRue8dDmIpH0aCg Femme Fatale Dark Cabaret Spotify playlist by aycaderenozkan]\n* [https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3NgT3F1ZLsmcQ6HfF7KmEr?si=59jKIEztTd2O0EuM0OCKpQ Femme Fatale \ud83d\udc8b Spotify playlist by Sunny]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3ZudM4AUqBhbt99pS5Vdjo break a mirror. roll a dice Spotify playlist by raviolae]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4ro5etw4AuvkenKb2wCAPm?si=aSNh6z97S7qiiyTEbq6B3Q pov: ur a villian Spotify playlist by Idk anymore UwU]\n\n<br />\n\n== Fictional Characters ==\n\n* Abigail Williams in ''The Crucible'' (1996)\n*Alice Morgan in ''Luther'' (2010-2019)\n*Irene Adler in ''Sherlock'' (2010-2017)\n* River Song in ''Doctor Who''\n* Simone in ''The Pink Panther'' (1963)\n\n== Movies ==\n\n* A Simple Favor (2018)\n*Anna (2018)\n*Ava (2020)\n*Charlies Angels movies\n*Chicago (2002)\n*Clue (1985)\n*Cruel Intentions (1999)\n*Focus (2015)\n*Gone Girl (2014)\n*Hustlers (2019)\n*Jennifer's Body (2009)\n*Kill Bill movies\n* Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005)\n*Promising Young Woman (2020)\n*Red Sparrow (2018)\n*The Dressmaker (2015)\n*The Love Witch (2016)\n* The Pink Panther (1963)\n*The Tourist (2010)\n\n== TV Shows ==\n\n*''Imposters'' (2017-2018)\n*''Killing Eve'' (2018-2022)\n*''Nikita'' (2010-2013)\n<gallery widths=\"185\">\nNoir.Film.FemmeFatale.jpg\nFemme-fatale-black-white-smoking-baddie.jpg\nFemmeFatale.jpg\nFemme-fatale-red-shades.jpg\nMafia-woman.jpg\nFemme-fatale-red-boots-heels.jpg\nRed.png\nBelong-no-one-myself.jpg\nPainting-woman-martini-bar.jpg\nBoot-licker-femme.jpg\nRed-nails-cut.jpg\nDevil-is-woman-compact-mirror-red.jpg\nBook-ladies-kill-red.jpg\nAnelina-jolie-femme-leather.jpg\nLingerie-knife-red.jpg\nFile:Seduce and destroy.jpg\n</gallery><br />\n[[Category:Written]]\n[[Category:Fashion]]\n[[Category:Visual]]\n[[Category:Needs work]]\n[[Category:Feminine]]\n[[Category:Sexy]]\n[[Category:Mature]]"}}}]}}}}
