Thus said, bands under this style live up to the meaning by dressing up in colorful costumes, or in [[Decora]] or [[Pop Kei]] style. So, many of them are seen sporting massive amounts of jewelry and bags of cartoon characters and animals slung on, tons of hairclips that make you go dizzy because you'd lose count, and lighter make-up. The music is more happy sounding, the lyrics lighter and happier. \n\n== Fashion ==\n\n* Bright, cheerful colors\n* Pastels\n* Brightly colored contacts\n* Dramatic black eyeliner\n* Animal print and polka dots\n* Biker chains\n* Arm warmers\n* Cuffs\n* Studded Bracelets\n* Goggles\n* Handcuffs\n* Buckles / straps\n* Rags tied around your wrist\n* Ripped jeans with bright leggings/socks underneath\n* Knee high socks, either striped or with bows\n* Fake eyelashes\n\n== Music ==\nOshare Kei is composed of music that is positive and upbeat.
