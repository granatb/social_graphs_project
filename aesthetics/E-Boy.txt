The style is very close to modern-day grunge with an additional emphasis on electronics.\n\n==Trends==\nE-Boys practice a lot of the same trends as the [[#E-Girl|E-Girl]] trend, like showing interest in anime and video games, having a persona of being soft yet sexy, striped clothes, dyed hair, tattoos beneath the eye, ect.\n\nThere are also some trends that are more emphasized in the E-Boy Aesthetic, such as:\n\n*Addiction and sad themes, similar to the [[Sadpeople|Sadboy]] aesthetic.\n*Chains.\n*Interest in emo rap/trap metal/phonk artists and bands such as GothBoiClique, $uicideboy$, Freddie Dredd, Ghostemane, Scarlxrd, Spider Gang, TeamSESH, Juice WRLD, City Morgue, nothing,nowhere., If I Die First, Shinigami, and Poorstacy.\n*Self-made temporary tattoos.\n*Chipped black nail polish.\n*Asymmetrical earrings.\n*Split-dyed hair.\n*Curtained hair (a.k.a \"middle part\"). Other hairstyles such as long bangs covering the eyes are popular as well.\n*Androgynous fashion.\n*[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punk_ideologies Punk ideologies.] (though this is more of something set in stone for most alternative subcultures and not so much a trend)\n*Shopping at thrift-stores and Hot Topic.\n*Interest in other alternative subcultures and music genres.\n\n==Fashion==\nSimilar to their female counterparts, E-Boy fashion tends to draw a lot of inspiration from [[Emo]], [[Scene]], [[Goth]], [[Punk]], [[Grunge]], and [[Animecore]]; invoking a sort of \"edge\" to their personality. They also tend to wear their [[Geek|geekiness]] on their sleeves as well and will either wear clothing showing off this geeky side, if not getting into outright [[Cosplay]] with some of their fashion choices. Some people have described younger Damon Albarn from The Blur (specifically for the music video \"[https://youtu.be/WDswiT87oo8 Girls and Boys]\") as the blueprint for the modern E-Boy, but Britpop tends to have nothing to do with E-Kids.\n\n== Resources ==\nExternal links to help get a better understanding of this aesthetic.\n\n===Playlists===\n\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2G3WCGjOYuTy8Z97A7KdAH?si=DPn7d0g4QR-GB5Uoysz9mg E boy playlist Spotify playlist by JodyJohnston]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2Aij0E933hsV6LXp1bbWSX?si=UfwsmWy9QhuU5BVZMTxYOQ E-Boy Vibes Spotify playlist by Jessica \ud83d\udda4\u2728]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/14tVpC8979JUZQktY1xYb4?si=eYO5iGo4SP-ydcs6Bx7U0Q E-Boy Bops Spotify playlist by Regan]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4Rxrbmf4EOCTYwfIh3F0O1?si=_6Hn9VmDS762X-RMFWjv6A \u271e E-boy \u271e Spotify playlist by Quin Kempker]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2d2AU1p1GDgHCVPVhrYLI7?si=XN9-OifGRfm86u8Uj4Njkg e-boy songs Spotify playlist by abstarzy]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7iKEjCC2sSLDsPMIWoumeT?si=tOEyFD-NTT-bL2n-u9g51g \ud83d\udda4 E-Boy \ud83d\udda4 Spotify playlist by ringler311075]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5QJmCrUgixHsYmUewmr4vc?si=wIb_4-KLTTuCex52kU9yGw black cuff beanie Spotify playlist by Albert Louis Baker]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/user/s94ew1pr2y8cex10xz8fga03x/playlist/5E4Oe30lIfy2s0qolYV9FV?si=5IOOsnqQR-iog_D2e7VIEw WHY AM I AN EBOY Spotify Playlist by sleepyyjax]\n\n=== Pinterest Boards ===\n\n*[https://www.pinterest.com/avamartenez/e-boy-aesthetic/ e-boy aesthetic by Ava martenez]\n*[https://www.pinterest.com/liualan75/e-boy-aesthetic/ e-boy aesthetic by Alan Rodrigues]\n*[https://www.pinterest.com/rihtuals/e-boy-aesthetic-clothing/ E-Boy aesthetic Clothing by shirousa]\n*[https://www.pinterest.com/aishiiiii/e-boy/ e-boy by I-oon]\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"130\" orientation=\"landscape\">\nEboy-face-chains.jpg\nD66b12f88bcc7192589384754b893b15.jpg\nPeople-are-poison.jpg\nEboy-smoke-up-cool-guy.jpg\nTumblr 65eadc05e3db48f45c836df8aee68671 675d13d1 640.jpg\nAre-you-lost.jpg\nEboy-sad-colorful.jpg\nEboy-floor.jpg\nFinger-heart-upsidedown.jpg\nEboy-blonde.jpg\nEboy-colors.jpg\nFinger-chains.jpg\nSadtimes4.jpeg\nE Boy Grunge.jpeg\n73e47c9882101e2af96587d0077414b5.jpg\nAf1e433aa07d1e74af38a6e4d20b6fa3.jpg\n042ac2e2e713e8fea6dc2efd49155529.jpg\nE-boy outfit.jpg.jpg\nEe4f132502594cfa007ea4d237f2a2b9.jpg\n4b5cadd4b8138fafed46618e90e189fb.jpg\n</gallery>\n<br />\n[[Category:Fashion]]\n[[Category:Visual]]\n[[Category:Music]]\n[[Category:Internet Subculture]]\n[[Category:Recognized Community]]\n[[Category:Sexy]]\n[[Category:Masculine]]\n[[Category:2010s]]"}}}]}}}}
