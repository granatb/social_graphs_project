It produced brighter, catchier alternative rock, partly in reaction to the popularity of the darker lyrical themes of the US-led grunge music and to the UK's own shoegazing music scene. Bands at the forefront of this scene were Blur, Oasis, Pulp, Elastica, Suede and the Verve.\u00a0\n\nThe movement is believed to have begun with the release of the single \"Popscene\" by Blur in 1992. This was followed by the release of their second studio album \"Modern Life Is Rubbish\" in 1993, which was conceived by Blur's frontman Damon Albarn as a reaction to the growing Americanisation of British culture. Another important band were Oasis, who achieved huge success in both the U.K. and the U.S.A. with their second studio album \"(What's the Story) Morning Glory?\".\u00a0\n\nBritpop as a whole fizzled out by 1997. This was due to three major events in 1997:\u00a0\n# Blur released their fifth studio album \"Blur\" in February 1997, which marked a departure from Britpop and saw the band dabbling in alternative rock, indie rock and lo-fi.\u00a0\n# Oasis released their third studio album \"Be Here Now\" in August 1997, which went on to receive overwhelmingly negative reviews for being overproduced, bloated and lengthy.\u00a0\n# The death of Princess Diana in August 1997.\u00a0\n[[Category:Music]]\n[[Category:Needs work]]\n[[Category:Pop Suffix]]\n[[Category:Candidates for Deletion]]\n[[Category:Plagiarized]]"}}}]}}}}
