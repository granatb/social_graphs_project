It includes having pets, reading books, and sitting next to a fireplace or window, or on a bed. Usually associated with [[Autumn]] and pumpkin spices, and with swift movements instead of challenges. Others also include reading, sleeping, watching movies or just doing nothing whilst at ease and petting your dog/cat.\n\nSpecific themes associated are messy beds as the symbolize one's unwillingness to wake up, and dreams (either be asleep or wish to). While the aesthetic is not as predominant on the several social media sites out there yet, such as Instagram, TikTok, and others, the community notably began and prospered on Tumblr.\n\nIt should be noted that this aesthetic sometimes is confused with Light Academia due to similar color palette and some key values. However, one main difference between the two is that Light Academia(and all aesthetics with the Academia suffix, for that matter) is that it is focused on learning, studying, and a thirst for knowledge. Comfy/Cozy's main idea is being comfortable, relaxed, and happy. \n\n== Visual ==\nElements of the Comfy/Cozy visual aesthetic include:\n\n*Stuffed animals\n*Playing on your electronics\n* Always tired\n*Beds and Sleep\n*Being terribly unorganized\n* Watching funny animal videos\n*Watching YouTube\n*Bags under your eyes\n*[https://www.themoodguide.com/slow-living-mood-guide/ This cozy mood visual guide]\n*Baked goods\n*Aromatherapy (candles, essential oils, incense, etc.)\n*Warm drinks\n*Soft lighting\n*Sweet treats\n\n== Activities ==\n\n* Relaxing hobbies\n* Writing/journaling\n* Practicing mindfulness\n\n== Fashion ==\nKey fashion features include many things, usually not tight and very casual: \n\n* Warm woolly socks\n* Soft blankets\n* Cardigans\n* Warm beverage in a mug\n* Knitted, woolly and oversized sweaters.\n* Messy buns\n* Glasses\n* Scarves\n* Flannel\n* Sweatpants\n* Graphic pajamas\n* No Makeup\n* Slippers\n* Clothes with animals on them\n\n== Music ==\n* Coffee shop soundtrack (e.g. the Lumineers)\n* Hozier\n*Lorde\n* Chilljazz instrumental\n*Gregory Alan Isakov (e.g. The Stable Song, Amsterdam, Living Proof, San Luis, Southern Star, San Francisco)\n*Murder by Death - Lost River\n*Bear's Den (e.g. Sophie, Berlin, Above The Clouds Of Pompeii, Only Son of the Falling Snow)\n*Johnny Flynn (Bulb Went Black, Shore to Shore)\n*Tall Ships - Home\n*Sarah Jarosz - Take Me Back\n*Ocie Elliott (e.g. Down By The Water, I Got You Honey, Stay Love, We Fall In)\n*Caamp (e.g. Misty, 'So Long, Honey')\n*Passenger (e.g. The Way That I Love You, 'Sometimes It's Something, Sometimes It's Nothing At All', Let Me Dream A While, Restless Wind)\n*Taylor Swift (e.g. Folklore Album, Evermore Album)\n*Animal Crossing OST (all the games)\n\n== Media ==\n\n=== Tv-Shows ===\n\n* Anne with an E\n*Over the Garden Wall\n*Friends\n*Bee and Puppycat\n\n=== Anime ===\n\n*Hyouka\n*Anohana\n*Violet Evergarden\n*Sound!
