It is seen as an direct foil to [[Goblincore]] and [[Crowcore]] due to its values of appreciating and collecting shiny, beautiful trinkets like jewels, coins and various gemstones, but it can also be collecting things of sentimental value to the user. The difference to the other two aesthetics lies in the hoard. Where goblins collect ugly and crows collect trivial things, a dragon collects \"worthy\" treasures.  \n\n<br />\n== Visual ==\nDue to its relatively recent creation, it hasn't yet properly developed the true specific values of what being Dragoncore is, commonly overlapping with other aesthetics, but this can also been seen as a good thing, as there aren't a lot of rules to go by, allowing the people of this aesthetic to express themselves however they like. This is part of why Dragoncore is a favorite of the [[otherkin]], therian and LGBTQIA+ communities, with the themes of not applying to usual gender labels.\n\nIt seems to have generally a respect of nature and its beauty, and a more elegant, refined well-kept vibe, compared to the messy aesthetic of its counterpart, more dim and darker lighting as well, and an appreciation of dragonic artwork and media of all sorts.\n\nDragons are connected to decadence, oppulence and elegance. Showing of your collection (be it the hoard of knowledge or the one of materialistic treasures) without it being distatefull. \n== Values ==\nNote: as put in the section above, Dragoncore doesn\u2019t really have any specific values as of now. \n\nThe values of Dragoncore are connected to the traits and personalities that are usually attributed to dragons in legends and modern media.\n\n* Intelligence\n* Wisdom\n*Independence\n*Strength\n*Freedom\n*Materialism\n*Selfcare\n*Ambition<br />\n\n== Books, Manga, & Comics ==\n\n*''Dragonology'' books\n*''Dragon's Bait''\n*''Dragonsdale'' and its sequel ''Riding the Storm''\n*''Dragon Rider''\n*''Dragonriders of Pern'' series\n*''Dragon Slippers'' series\n*''Elmer and the Dragon''\n*''Enchanted Forest Chronicles'' \n*''Eragon'' series\n*''Game of Thrones''\n*''His Majesty's Dragon'' series\n*''How to Train Your Dragon'' books\n*''Lord of the Rings'' trilogy\n*''My Fathers Dragon''\n*''Pit Dragon Trilogy''\n*''Seraphina'' series\n*''The Hobbit''\n*''Wings of Fire'' series\n*''Wings of Fire'' graphic novels\n*''The Last Dragon Chronicles series''\n*''How To Become a Dragon''\n\n== Movies/TV series ==\n\n*''How To Train Your Dragon''\n*''Lord of the Rings''\n*''The Hobbit''\n*''Game of Thrones''\n\n== Activities ==\n\n* Starting a new collection\n*Collecting treasure you find (coins, pins, etc.)\n* Washing and cleaning the treasures you have in your hoard\n*Organizing previous collections\n*Admiring your treasures\n*Cleaning your living space\n* Spending time with and taking care of your pets\n* Studying \n* Protecting and taking care of the other people in your flock of dragons\n* Taking time by yourself to reflect on your morals, beliefs and life decisions\n*For religious people: spending time practicing your religion\n*Pursuing your hobbies\n*Doing what you enjoy\n*Doing a Random act of kindness \n*Reading dragon related books or watching dragon related movies\n*Drawing dragons, sculpting dragons or creating dragons out of other miscellaneous things\n\n<br />\n\n== Fashion ==\nFashion can be separeted into two different takes on dragoncore. One is centered around cosplaying and larping, the second idea speculates about the choices of a dragon in modern (in perspective of a dragon, for us oldfashioned) fashion. Both would make use of large amounts of jewellry.  \n=== Fantasy ===\n\n* Capes, wings, cloaks, fake tails, fake fangs, etc.\n* Black nail polish to represent talons if you really want to look every bit of a dragon as you can\n* Eyeliner\n* Dragon accessories like bracelets with wings on them, earrings with dragons on them, etc.\n* Combat boots\n\n=== Modern ===\n\n* well-cut suits and waistcoats, tailor made, \n* exotic and excentric materials\n* Brogue/Full Brogue Shoes\n* pocket watches, wristwatches\n* rings and earrings, bracelets (regardless of gender)\n* Rubies and garnets\n* Gold, black and red/burgundy\n\nNote: It may be that some things I list may seem like odd clothing choices to you, I simply tried to brainstorm based off of dragon pictures I found. These are simply ideas.
