It is similar to [[Light Academia]] and [[Dark Academia]] in its value of studying, dedicated practice of learned interests, 18-19th century-inspired aesthetics, and architecture, but is unique in focusing primarily on the visual arts. \n\n\n\n==Visuals==\nArt academia is centered primarily around the visual arts, and as such is primarily a visual aesthetic. Color schemes are generally warm and neutral with bright colors either scattered throughout or focused to draw the viewers' attention. \n\nPopular visuals include (but may not be limited to):\n\n*Sculpture\n**Pre-modern sculpture\n***Greek\n***Roman\n*Sketches\n*Doodles\n*Diagrams\n*Calligraphy\n*Cartology\n**Stylized cartography\n*Photographs\n*Architecture\n**Places of learning\n***Universities\n***Museums\n\n==Courses==\nPeople who partake in this aesthetic typically study at a college or a university, and therefore have to choose from a variety of subjects. Students choose specific courses to suit their future career or personal interest. Some of them include:\n\n*Ceramics\n*Drawing\n*Colour Theory\n*Perspective\n*Graphic Design\n*History of Art\n*Painting\n*Print Making\n*Sculpture\n*Visual Arts\n*Water Color\n*Animation\n*Typography\n*World Arts\n\n==Activities==\nGenerally, all activities are somehow related to learning about art or interacting with it. Of course, it can be done in different forms, such as:\n\n*Walking through museums and galleries\n*Attending life drawing classes\n*Drawing in general\n*Creating art pieces (e.g. charcoal portraits)\n*Writing creatively\n*Admiring architecture and the ageless faces of statues\n*Reading books\n*Listening to music\n*Journaling\n*Playing music\n*Painting\n*Attending plays\n*Attending the theater\n*Analyzing films\n*Photography\n\n==Fashion==\nWhat you wear doesn't matter as long as you have an interest in studying arts and attend an educational department. Presumably, as for many students, comfort and availability are prioritised. Maybe having a couple of pockets to carry some paint tubes and brushes, or a ponytail, so the hair doesn't touch the canvas sound reasonable. Other examples can be:\n\n*Collared shirts with puffy sleeves\n*Berets\n*Oxfords\n*Corduroy\n*Overalls\n*Braids, ponytails and messy buns\n*Wool sweaters \n*Loose t-shirts \n*Earthy colors\n\n==Movies==\nAll of the movies associated with Art Academia are movies about artists. They are usually old and outdated movies.\n\n*Painters Painting: The New York Art Scene (1940-1970)\n*Visit to Picasso (1949)\n*The Agony and the Ecstacy (1965)\n*Golub: Late Works are the Catastrophes (1988)\n*La Belle Noiseuse (1991)\n*What Remains: The Life and Work of Sally Mann (2005)\n*Seraphine (2008)\n*Dorothea Lange: Grab a Hunk of Lightning (2014)\n*Loving Vincent (2017)\n*KUSAMA - INFINITY (2018)\n*Museum Town (2019)\n\n==Music==\nAll of the following artists contribute to Art Academia:\n\n===Artists===\n*Cigarettes After Sex\n*Crisaunt\n*Cults\n*Dayglow\n*FINNEAS\n*Frank Ocean\n*Harmless\n*JAWNY\n*Joji\n*Llusion\n*M83\n*Mac DeMarco\n*Matt Maltese\n*Men I Trust\n*MGMT\n*Mild High Club\n*mxmtoon\n*Still Woozy\n* Strawberry Guy\n*Troye Sivan\n\n<br />\n==Resources==\nExternal links to help get a better understanding of this aesthetic.\n\n*[https://cordurose.tumblr.com/post/615391766259089408/does-art-academia-exist-if-so-may-you-please The information for '''activities''' has been provided by Cordurose]\n*[https://cordurose.tumblr.com/post/615481490073174016/pardon-me-but-i-another-question-on-art-academia The information for '''fashion''' has been provided by Cordurose]\n*[https://www.artandobject.com/press-release/10-films-about-art-worth-watching The information for '''movies''' has been provided by Art & Object]\n\n===Pinterest Boards===\n\n*[https://www.pinterest.com/neisasnook/art-academia/ Art Academia by Neisa]\n*[https://br.pinterest.com/silverz_/aesthetic/art-academia/ Aesthetic \u2666\ufe0e Art Academia \u2666\ufe0e by Silverz]\n*[https://www.pinterest.com/Ethereal_Daydreams/academia-aesthetics/art/ Academia Aesthetics- Art- by Cosmic Lust]\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"180\" orientation=\"none\" columns=\"3\" spacing=\"small\">\nTumblr 9b7534d705c5db738b3e89dff66db95c c639aeb1 640.jpg\nCinderelsx.jpg\n\u2601\ufe0f\u2022OLD VOGUE\u2022\u2601\ufe0f by \ud835\udc00.jpg\nArt museum.jpg\nBy \ud835\udce8\ud835\udcea\ud835\udcfc\ud835\udcf6\ud835\udcf2\ud835\udcf7\ud835\udcee.jpg\nDibujo Art\u00edstico.jpg\nBy \u062a\u064e\u0628\u0640\u0627\u0631\u0643\u0640 \u0652.jpg\nSketchbooks.jpg\nRome art galleries.jpg\nBye-bye, butterfly.png\nIt's what's happening.jpg\nArt academia.jpg\n\u270c\ufe0f\u270c\u270c -.jpg\nHow wonderful.jpg\nChaos.jpg\n@apt 605.png\nInspiraion.jpg\nArts.jpg\nBeautiful.jpg\nL \u00e9 v i t a t e.jpg\nArt Academia Painting.jpeg\nVenus de milo.jpeg\nScreen Shot 2021-01-11 at 2.17.48 PM.png\nDrawings.jpg\nStatues.jpg\nMuesum.jpg\nFeeling comfortable.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n[[Category:Visual]]\n[[Category:Academia]]\n[[Category:Art]]\n[[Category:Music]]\n[[Category:Movies]]\n[[Category:Fashion]]"}}}]}}}}
