This particular aesthetic ranges from human bred dogs to wild wolves, containing lots of sub genres. Caninecore is generally centered around being a dog enthusiast, and doesn't have much of a history.    \n\nCaninecore often takes other aesthetics and blends them with canines. For instance, [[Cottagecore|cottagecore]] mixed with  caninecore would look very different to [[Cryptidcore|cryptidcore]] mixed with caninecore. Caninecore by itself is a very flexible aesthetic, the only requirement for caninecore is canines. \n\nCaninecore is often influenced by therianthropy, animal-hearted people, pet regressors, and furries. Caninecore is especially popular on Tumblr and Pinterest and within the general art community.\n\n\n==Visual==\nCaninecore often includes (nearly exclusively) pictures of wolves and other types of canines, as well as possibly mountain scenery for the ideal visual of traveling in a pack that followers of Caninecore desire.\n\nColours involved with this aesthetic are natural colours such as greens, browns, and other earthy tones. There is a lot of variety within the aesthetic, going from house dogs to street dogs, to wolves or other wild dogs.\n\nNotable artists include [https://howlsnteeth.tumblr.com/ howlsnteeth] and [https://ericawilliamsillustration.com/ Erica Williams] ([https://www.instagram.com/hookieduke/?hl=en hookieduke]).\n<br />\n\n===Pinterest Boards===\n\n*[https://www.pinterest.co.uk/fischloves/caninecore/ CANINECORE \u0f0a*\u00b7\u02da]\n*[https://www.pinterest.co.uk/elerijoness/caninecore/ caninecore]\n*[https://www.pinterest.co.uk/elerijoness/dogcore/ dogcore]\n*[https://www.pinterest.co.uk/elerijoness/cursed-images-but-make-them-dogs/ cursed images but make them dogs]\n*[https://www.pinterest.com.mx/diegopinkberry/pomeranian/ pomeranian]<br /><br />\n\n<br />\n\n==Fashion==\nCaninecore fashion sometimes contains visuals of canines, whilst other times it may be clothing that reflects the general vibe of the aesthetic.

This aesthetic emphasizes happy and uplifting vibes, along with the cuteness of dogs. The bond between dog and owner may also be a motif, amplifying that friendships/ companionship.\n\nIt can be linked to [[Petcore]]. \n\nThis particular sub genre is mostly influenced by pet regressors and dog/ pet enthusiasts. Visuals very often include cute dog toys, such as colourful teddies and tug toys. \n\nMedia that links to domestic dogcore may include A Dog's Purpose and Lassie.\n\nDomestic dogcore fashion mostly consists of cosy clothes, and possibly hiking clothes for dog walking, along with any clothing that depicts images of dogs.\n\n=== Doggo ===\n\n\nDoggo tends to go for more of a cutsie meme-y look. Although all dogs are welcome in this sub genre it tends to focus on Shibe Inu's the most. \n[[File:Doggo.jpg|thumb|176x176px|a traditional doggo type image]]\nIt contains imagery of doggos with edits and words describing how they feel as if they were talking. It has focus on vibrant colors such as: Blue, Yellow, And Pink\n\nIt also features staples of internet culture such as The Doge meme, Doggo-Lingo, and don't boop the snoot.\n<br />\n===Dogcore (Streetdog)===\nThis sub genre still features dogs, however it is linked to \"the streets\" and sometimes nature. Street Dogcore contains more elements of loneliness and being self sufficient, and may also feature ideas of pack mentality. \n\nImagery may include derelict streets and a [[grunge]] like atmosphere. \n\nThis aesthetic is mostly influenced by (but not exclusively enjoyed by) therians.\n<br />\n<br />\n===Caninecore (Furry)===\nThis branch of caninecore is inspired by the furry community, and is vastly different to the other sub genres. The color schemes are often bright and unnatural, sometimes using the [https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/sparkledogs sparkle dog] concept. \n\nThis sub genre contains imagery of fursuits and art of fursonas. \n<br />\n[[File:Wolves howling wolfcore wolfaboo.jpg|alt=Two wolves stood on a rock howling. a forest of trees is behind them.|thumb]]<br />\n===Wolfcore/Wolfaboo/Werewolf===\nWolfcore, as stated in the name, focuses on wolves. Wolfcore visuals include the outdoors, specifically vast mountain ranges and deep forests. \n\nThis genre is influenced by therians and animal hearted people. \n\nWolfcore themes include pack mentality, appreciation for nature, and a connection to/ appreciation for wolves.\n\nWhilst wolfaboo is often separate to this, wolfaboo started as a copy of the word weeaboo, to describe somebody who is very enthusiastic about wolves and has sometimes been used in a negative way. However, this word has developed similar to the way the word weeaboo has developed, and is now mostly used in a positive or descriptive way.\n<br />\n<br />\n[[File:Foxcore fox.jpg|left|thumb]]\n\n===Foxcore===\nFoxcore includes imagery of nature, specifically of deep forests. Orange is the main color of foxcore, since it is the color of the red fox. \n\nThis genre's imagery is often similar to that of [[Goblincore]], and it may contain similar motifs to [[Dragoncore]] (due to the perceived nature of foxes). \n\nThemes may include independence, being 'sneaky' or 'sly'. \n\nFashion includes warm comfy jumpers, and anything nature/ forest themed. Autumnal themes such as fall leaves are also a common visual within foxcore. Foxcore is also therian and animal hearted inspired.\n\n<br />\n\n==Media==\n<br />\n\n===Books===\n\n*''Survivors'' - Erin Hunter\n*''White Fang'' and ''Call of The Wild''- Jack London\n*''Marley & Me''-John Grogan\n\n<br />\n\n=== Movies===\n\n*''A Dog's Purpose''\n*''Lassie''\n*''Rin Tin Tin''\n*''Benji''\n*''Isle of Dogs''\n*''The Plague Dogs''\n*''Balto''\n*''Oliver and Company''\n*''Lady and The Tramp'' (and ''Lady and The Tramp: Scamp's Adventure'')\n*''101 Dalmatians''\n*''Fox and the Hound'' (and ''Fox and the Hound 2'')\n*''All Dogs Go To Heaven''\n*''Old Yeller''\n*''Wolfwalkers''\n\n<br />\n\n===TV Shows===\n\n*''Teen Wolf''\n*''Dog With a Blog''\n*''Pound Puppies''\n*''Road Rovers''\n*''Wishbone''\n*''The Littlest Hobo''\n*''Lassie''\n*''The Pack''\n\n== Resources ==\nExternal links to help get a better understanding of this aesthetic.\n\n<br />\n===Playlists===\n\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5qOO9wPfggNCemmCAqUdd9?si=K0MRaGBqRlaT3St__nLrNQ \"beneath the tress\"] by Jax (folk based)\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6fbkPICXtl5QYGEMW6xKJt?si=BdpL-mM-TAKZRiJ_A12Dlw \"puppycore :)\"] by sleepyjax\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0w5Tv7mgBkaEMUFWGF8bH0?si=UPZLKzWBQjSJs__AaIIimw \"caninecore\"] by sleepyjax\n*\"[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6lL62IuUIKhlQal9kJPjjV?si=7n22rPVbSPGwHAEpNUUetw Caninecore]\" by ash\n*\"[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6HompGY9HdBJYc16tsDDI6?si=NQyrCYd2SAGfnXiVup31hA Puppycore]\" by Puppy\n*\"[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0gYjKZBfEJqs6w4VcSgjck?si=ePrK4bT6QxCjFQTVBSqDxg PUPPYCORE]\" by nateisweerrd\n*\"[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5u5SFn7qLOMgj0gTwPX4Tm?si=3f6470e9c904418a i'm going to live in the woods]\" by sleepyjax\n\n==Gallery==\n<br /><gallery widths=\"185\">\nDog on hill.jpg\nDomestic dogcore.jpg\nDog in leaves.jpg\nGolden retriever in a field .jpg\nCaninecore dogcore rainbow dalmatian.jpg\nWolf howling.jpg\nWolf head in hand.jpg\nCaninecore dogcore hotdog.jpg\nWolf in forest.jpg\nCaninecore dogcore german sheapard at the beach.jpg\nHappy wolves.jpg\nCaninecore dogcore samoyed wearing glasses.jpg\nWolves howling wolfcore wolfaboo.jpg\nCaninecore doggles.jpg\nCaninecore wolfcore wolves stood in mud.jpg\nCaninecore facetime.jpg\nDog on roof.jpg\nCaninecore paw prints in clay.jpg\nLick.jpg\nDog.jpg\nHusko.jpg\nPupperdoodle.jpg\nSquished-face_pupper.jpg\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Visual]]\n[[Category:Core Suffix]]\n[[Category:Cute]]"}}}]}}}}
