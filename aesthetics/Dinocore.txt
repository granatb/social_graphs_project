The main themes is nature and prehistoric times, and learning/appreciating both. It's related to animal aesthetics, but instead of focusing on cute or cuddly creatures, the animal is extinct and a reptile. This aesthetic doesn't just focus on prehistoric times, as things such as the fashion or d\u00e9cor tend to have a more simplified and (subjectively) cuter versions of dinosaurs. This aesthetic has a relation to Kidcore due to dinosaurs being popular amongst children.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n\n== Visual ==\n[under construction]\n\n== Fashion Dinosaur themed clothing, including but not limited to: ==\n\n** Long cozy socks\n** Safari hats\n** Doc Martens\n**Neutral tone backpacks\n**Fingerless Gloves (Crime gloves)\n**\n**\n**\n\n== Popular Personality Traits ==\n<nowiki>*</nowiki>Note: Just because you do or don't have these personality traits doesn't determine whether this aesthetic is for you.\n\n* Adventurous \n\n* Curious\n* Chaotic-Good\n* Extroverted\n*Brave\n\n== Activities ==\n\n* Researching/Memorizing dinosaurs\n* Watching Jurassic World/Park related media\n* Doing Paleontologists kits\n*Playing in mud\n*Reading books about dinosaurs\n*Making Dinosaur Terrariums\n*Hiking\n*Making dinosaur eggs\n\n== Pinterest Boards ==\n[I will make one on my Pinterest very soon!) \n\n<br />\n\n== Media ==\n\n=== Movies ===\n\n*''Gertie the Dinosaur'' (1914)\n*''The Land Before Time'' (1988)\n*''Jurassic Park'' (1993)\n*''Dinosaur'' (2000)\n*''Jurassic World'' (2015)\n*Jurassic Park Camp Cretaceous \n\n=== TV ===\n\n* Dinosaurs (1991)\n\n=== Anime/Manga ===\n\n* ''Dinosaur king''\n\n\n== Music ==\nStrawberry dino : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glMwIFk_XjQ\n\nDinosaurs in love: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujby_E-5obQ&feature=youtu.be\n\nJurassic Park Theme - Slow/Normal\n\nJurassic Park Ending Theme\n\n== Websites ==\n[under construction]<br />\n\n== Gallery ==\n[[File:Cursed emoji but dino.jpg|thumb|259x259px]]This gallery will show a few pictures that may be disturbing to some audience.
