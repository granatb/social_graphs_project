It is broadly associated with\u00a0indie\u00a0and\u00a0alternative\u00a0music and genres, such as\u00a0chill-out,\u00a0folk,\u00a0modern rock,\u00a0pop rock and\u00a0post-Britpop. Hipsters also frequently flaunt a varied\u00a0non-mainstream fashion sensibility, wearing\u00a0vintage\u00a0and\u00a0thrift store-bought clothing; hold\u00a0pacifist\u00a0and\u00a0green\u00a0views; are often\u00a0vegan; consume\u00a0organic and artisanal foods, and craft alcoholic beverages; and live\u00a0alternative lifestyles. The roots of the hipster aesthetic date back to the 1940s, but the modern-day version did not reach the height of its popularity until the late 2000s or early 2010s.\n\n\n\n== Visual ==\n''Under Construction''\n\n== Fashion ==\nHipster Fashion revolves around the idea of rejecting the 'mainstream' trends and utilizing unique or 'quirky' items to define an outfit. This can be anything from someones hairstyle, to their sock. \nFrequent trends include:\n* Moustache \n* Full beard\n* Tattoos\n* Beanie hat\n* Newsboy cap\n* Horn-rimmed glasses\n* Round sunglasses\n* Bowtie\n* Camera (often vintage)\n* Pipe\n* Suspenders\n* Vests\n* Scarfs (worn inside and outside, all year round)\n* Plaid shirts\n* Vintage clothing\n* Vintage imagery on clothing (vinyl decals, typewriter font, ect.)\n* Skinny jeans\n* Brand colorful pants\n* Patterned and brightly colored socks\n* Converse\n* Messenger bags\n* Canvas bags\n\n== Music ==\n* Mumford & Sons\n* The Lumineers\n* Of Monsters and Men\n* The Head and the Heart\n* Vance Joy\n* Noah and the Whale\n* George Ezra\n* Passenger\n\n== Subgenres ==\n\n=== Cutester ===\n\n'''Cutester''' is an aesthetic that invokes the feeling (or appearance) of being cute. This applies to people who wear child-like clothing, acts in a way that invokes cuteness or anything of the sort.\u00a0This is what it looks like when one takes the [[Kidcore]] aesthetic and added a few dashes into the Hipster aesthetic.\n\n=== Fixed Gear Hipster ===\nA '''Fixed Gear Hipster''' (or ''fixie hipster'') describes a hipster riding atop a\u00a0fixed gear\u00a0bicycle often termed as a fixie. Although, the heritage of fixed gear cycling dates to professional couriers, messengers, and track cycling. It is unclear how this style of cycling became popular with them. However, it is generally believed that owning a fixed-gear bicycle has been labeled \"trendy\" within hipster culture.\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery widths=\"135\">\nCute.PNG|An example of a \"Cutester\"\nCutester-outfit-2jpg.jpg|An example of a Cutester outfit\n4c03c2c9df62dca525f6ca730325e984.jpg\n44-signs-you-might-be-a-hipster1.jpg\nHipster.jpg.optimal.jpg\n0a77f05b-c0ad-479d-a9c0-a69e35f21f0a-abandoned-homes-america-dicksonia-plantation-alabama-3.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n[[Category:Visual]]\n[[Category:Fashion]]\n[[Category:Needs work]]\n[[Category:Mainstream]]\n[[Category:2010s]]"}}}]}}}}
