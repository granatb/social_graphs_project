For the most part these people were white, and either Americans from the East Coast or European immigrants. (After the American Civil War, a significant population of Black pioneers known as the Exodusters existed but their motivations and experiences were somewhat different from white pioneers. They were not part of the image of the American Pioneer that existed in the 19th Century and little attention is given to them in both historical fiction and American History lessons.) \n\nPioneers were motivated by Manifest Destiny, a concept within American culture that claims that God has ordered the American people to make the nation occupied from the Atlantic to the Pacific. Violence towards Native Americans was considered a necessary evil in the pursuit of this goal. \n\nThe visual tropes associated with pioneer life are distinctive and familiar to Americans. They are inspired by the travel equipment and landscape along the routes west. Much of the allure of this is the ruggedness and self-sufficiency of the people in contrast to the wild, untamed nature of their surroundings.  \n\nThe hardship that the people who traveled along the Oregon Trail faced is often a point of fascination and shock value. The Donner Party, a group of families that resorted to cannibalism in the wintertime, has been used as a point of horror and portrayal of the extremes that humans can go to when they are desperate.  \n\n== Controversy ==\nColonialism. Racism. \n\nThe Donner Party's choice to resort to cannibalism was previously seen as inevitable. In more recent times, it was discovered that the party refused the advice and assistance of local Native Americans, and their cannibalism was the result of poor decision making.\n\nAmerican historian David McCullough's ''The Pioneers'', caused controversy due to its use of the word \"savages\" to describe Native Americans.<br />\n\n== Visuals ==\n\n* covered wagons\n* oxen\n* horses\n* log cabins\n* sod houses\n* sunbonnets\n* aprons\n* axes\n* buffalo\n* patchwork quilts\n* campfires\n* banjos\n* fiddles\n* washtubs and washboards\n* cast iron pots\n* hunting rifles\n* one room schoolhouse\n* wildflowers\n* wheat fields and corn fields\n* chickens and eggs\n* homemade jam, cheese, bread, pies, sausage\n* cows<br />\n\n== Media ==\n\n=== Anime ===\n\n*''Laura, the Prairie Girl'' (1975-1976)\n\n=== Books ===\n\n*''The Little House'' series by Laura Ingalls Wilder\n*''O Pioneers'' by Willa Cather\n*''Sarah, Plain and Tall'' series by Patricia MacLachlan\n*''Caddie Woodlawn'' series by Carol Ryrie Brink\n*''The Ballad of Lucy Whipple'' by Karen Cushman\n*''The Cabin Faced West'' by Jean Fritz\n*''Prairie School'' by Lois Lenski\n*''Our Only May Amelia'' by Jennifer L.
