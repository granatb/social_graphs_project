There are two camps of Indie, as the aesthetic underwent a modern resurgence in 2019-2020 labeled Indie Kid. Indie Kid is a bright, colorful style usually involving oversized jeans, large hoodies, and small shirts. This aesthetic rose to fame again through the app TikTok and centers around bright colors, 2000s-style fashion, and a [[skater]] lifestyle. This resurgence differs from the original Indie style which did not include such bright colors and was considered more \"alternative\" by today's standards. This style involved a variety of independent music genres, including [[shoegaze]]. This can also include the indie movie genre, as many movies in the genre add to the original indie aesthetic. \n\n\n==Visual==\nThe Indie aesthetic was, in many ways, similar to the [[Pastel]] aesthetic, however, the color is paler and even less intense.  Another key difference between the two is while the Pastel aesthetic conveys a sense of innocence and sweetness, the Indie aesthetic conveys more of a darker, moodier tone. Photos in this aesthetic often have sad text overlaid to further communicate the mood. Indie blogs also often feature photos of ornate architectural spaces, snow-covered landscapes, and bruised skin. \n\nHowever, nowadays, there is also a specific way that videos and photos are edited. There are plenty of indie filters to choose from, but they all have some things in common. It's heavy on saturation and vibrance, and the contrast is lowered. The grain or noise effect is sometimes added as well. These videos and photos are most commonly edited on the Camera app on an iPhone.\n\n===Resources===\nPinterest boards are a good way to get inspiration related to an aesthetic.\n\n*[https://www.pinterest.com/thildeuberg/indie/ indie by thilde \ud83e\uddc3]\n*[https://www.pinterest.com/sydneyols/indie-fashion/ Indie fashion by Sydney Olsen]\n*[https://www.pinterest.com/PinterestUK/indie-inspiration/ Indie Inspiration by Pinterest UK]\n*[https://www.pinterest.com/lucygracelamber/indie-alt/ indie, alt by Lucy Grace]\n*[https://www.pinterest.com/clabert79/indie/ Indie by Claudio]\n*[https://www.pinterest.com/celinecassis/indie/ indie by celine]\n*[https://www.pinterest.com/1strash/vintage-indie-grunge/ : vintage \u2605 indie \u2605 grunge by holytrash]\n*[https://www.pinterest.com/bubly_99/vintage-indie/ vintage & indie by Seni Marou]\n*[https://www.pinterest.com/pastelevan17/indieemo-aesthetic/ indie/emo aesthetic by evan]\n\n==Fashion==\nOld school Indie fashion was pretty vague and unassuming. Many pieces were thrifted and casual, a bit more digestible and easier to assemble than [[Grunge]] although very similar. It is borderline [[Normcore]] due to how wide the spectrum of the fashion is, the common theme is individuality so personal preference is the biggest value present. Some other common factors include darker colors and alternative tendencies. \n\n* Band and brand t-shirts\n* Cardigans\n* Jeans\n* Tennis shoes, boots, Chuck Taylors\n* Jean, leather jackets\n* Pea, puffer coats\n* Flannel\n* Rayban sunglasses\n* Skullcaps and beanies\n* Little to no jewelry\n* Natural hair and makeup\n\n\nToday, Indie Kid fashion is very similar to the fashion trends of the 2000s.This includes:\n\n* Crop tops\n* Baggy pants and jeans\n* Oversized tees and sweatshirts \n* Collared shirts\n* Converse, Vans, Air Force Ones, Adidas\n\nMakeup is natural or bright, sometimes heavy blush, and hair is worn however they feel like although bright colors are common.\n\nBrands where you can find these things are Princess Polly, Shein, Brandy Melville, Francesca's, American Eagle, Vans, and various thrift stores.\n\n=== Stores & Brands ===\n\n*[https://americanapparel.com/ American Apparel] \n*[https://shopcamp.com/ Camp Collection]\n*[https://orezoria.com/collection/indie-aesthetic-clothes/ Orezoria]\n*[https://www.etsy.com/shop/birdwithcowboyhat?ref=seller-platform-mcnav Birdwithcowboyhat]\n\n==Music==\nIndependently released music is not directly financially dependent on any of the four major labels (WMG, Sony BMG, EMI, and Universal).  Specifically, Indie rock, a genre of rock music that originated in the United States and the United Kingdom in the 1970s, is very popular in indie circles. Originally used to describe independent record labels, the term became associated with the music they produced and was initially used interchangeably with alternative rock.  Popular musicians in the Indie scene include:\n\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIgmyE5Juzw&list=PLXq9PtMDC0hPzLa06L5-bR6h5tBlhDjCB Wallows]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mngtcfcaVrI&t=18s Clairo]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMK_npDG12Q&list=PLfhekZn7a-5JLyAG7w_T5flSAkmRwIVDD Lorde]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iyy3YOpxL2k The 1975]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otPB54Wxf5c Dayglow]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAi39ZNt0OE jxdn]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FeD16vu_qQ Neutral Milk Hotel]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xZDPPfHP-8 Bromheads Jacket]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZCZRTcY3uA Tilly And The Wall]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghb6eDopW8I Of Monsters and Men]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXwYJyrKK5ATwo Door Cinema Club]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxJhrwyn0M4&list=PLAae0lVtcVF3RTFqydcf8PwmLy_9t4RDH Young the Giant]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=due-qiswArQ Jeff Rosenstock]\n*[https://youtu.be/dc6SSu5pnHw Beach Bunny]\n*[https://youtu.be/iggmiF7DNoM girl in red]\n*[https://youtu.be/gykWYPrArbY SALES]\n*[https://youtu.be/AeUeLzBO0go mxmtoon]\n*[https://youtu.be/2APLh8_ExU0 Cavetown]\n\n== Playlists ==\n\n* [https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3qDbMPu5TW1707am1jP6VK?si=3966435ed5654b86 i n d i e ] spotify playlist by miraya \u2601\ufe0f\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2rSZRKOJCf8wTNCbTG2wGo?si=4b411b799d7b4e2d AESTHETICS: indie by Chaotic Good] \n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/54KBZJ6fF1KvX1U3BHqj9h?si=2uL69BFPQS6H1R5yJ7fEfQ&dl_branch=1 Indie Vibes~] Spotify playlist by Finch\n*[https://open.spotify.com/user/spotify/playlist/37i9dQZF1DWWEcRhUVtL8n?si=IRYZ5x8GRzO6MEA1Vt2nDw&dl_branch=1 Indie Pop] Spotify playlist by Spotify\n*[https://open.spotify.com/user/spotify/playlist/37i9dQZF1DX30HHrCAl4ZG?si=JeW-yhzZS7WY61JuP1cfrA&dl_branch=1 today\u2019s Indie Rock] Spotify playlist by Spotify\n*[https://open.spotify.com/user/spotify/playlist/37i9dQZF1DX2Nc3B70tvx0?si=s2K5MT4gTNWllcqY6oUE0w&dl_branch=1 Ultimate Indie] Spotify playlist by Spotify\n\n==Lifestyle==\nIndie Kids often live their lives as if they're in an A24 coming-of-age movies, highlighting skating with friends, getting food from gas stations, blasting music, and filming all the while. Restaurants such as In-N-Out Burger and 7-Eleven are popular places for indie kids to go and eat food, due to their overall embodiment of the aesthetic.\n== Gallery==\n<gallery orientation=\"none\" widths=\"130\">\nOIP - 2020-10-14T145535.350.jpg\nOIP - 2020-10-14T145547.720.jpg\nOIP - 2020-10-14T145637.620.jpg\nOIP - 2020-10-14T145543.250.jpg\nOIP - 2020-10-14T145511.900.jpg\nOIP - 2020-10-14T145644.891.jpg\nOIP - 2020-10-14T145519.149.jpg\n1BE59C4E-ED0D-418C-8103-D5717DA6A81E.jpeg\nD8750B08-586A-4031-9C84-40B53FDD4BAB.jpeg\n31A546C6-BF40-4ED3-99F1-61010FAEBDB3.jpeg\nE43398AE-CE14-438D-B010-21D66FBE3BE1.jpeg\n956BD5AF-A537-4F75-AE04-A26B694B26AC.jpeg\nIndieMin.09.PNG\nIndie-room.jpg\nIndie-flannel.jpg\nIndie-bucket-hat.jpg\nIndie-forest.jpg\nIndie-beach.jpg\nIndie-festival.jpg\nIndie-field.jpg\nAcd1b6253298d1bbc8766379011ec4da.jpg\nC1573ed5dc85b72553dc998b56268cfe.jpg\n924c7044ab3f59edf3905f06ed303418.jpg\n49e4e1da03e3a9ef0df2e3ac46e1de92.jpg\n730b038e6e2e076e3549893d4376a60a.jpg\n10b02c4d013e4fd52e968ca22893d731.jpg\n9009847fd30cfc550beff4d06b92b6ae.jpg\n3d5cb4c88631c49e5337faae3b8ad0ab.jpg\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Visual]]\n[[Category:Needs work]]\n[[Category:Fashion]]\n[[Category:Music]]\n[[Category:Needs work]]\n[[Category:Recognized Community]]"}}}]}}}}
