The movement originated in Russia in the 1920s and has influenced many aspects of modern architecture and design. \n\nAbstract and austere, constructivist art aimed to reflect modern industrial society and urban space. The movement rejected decorative stylization in favor of the industrial assemblage of materials. Constructivists were in favour of art for propaganda and social purposes, and were associated with Soviet socialism, the Bolsheviks and the Russian avant-garde. \n\n== Origins and influences ==\nIt was an\u00a0artistic\u00a0and\u00a0architectural\u00a0philosophy that originated in\u00a0Russia\u00a0beginning in 1915 by\u00a0Vladimir Tatlin\u00a0and\u00a0Alexander Rodchenko.\u00a0Abstract and austere, constructivist art aimed to reflect modern\u00a0industrial society\u00a0and urban space.\u00a0The movement rejected aesthetic stylization in favor of the industrial assemblage of materials.\u00a0Constructivists were in favour of art for practical and social purposes, and were associated with Soviet\u00a0socialism\u00a0and the\u00a0Russian avant-garde. Constructivist architecture\u00a0and art had a great effect on modern art movements of the 20th century, influencing major trends such as the\u00a0Bauhaus\u00a0and\u00a0De Stijl\u00a0movements. Its influence was widespread, with major effects upon architecture,\u00a0sculpture,\u00a0graphic design,\u00a0industrial design, theatre, film, dance, fashion and, to some extent, music.\n\nThe Aesthetic in the USSR generally declined under the leadership of Joseph Stalin, who advocated for and imposed Socialist Realism and more classically inspired aesthetics for the USSR to uphold, believing they would better appeal to the Proletariat as opposed to the Constructivist genre thought to appeal only to Intelligentsia. \n\nIf you wish to find out more about this, visit https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructivism_(art)\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery widths=\"130\">\nConstructivist.jpeg\nConstructivism 4.jpg\nRussian_maybe.png\nCon art.jpg\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Written]]\n[[Category:Visual]]\n[[Category:Art]]\n[[Category:Movement]]\n[[Category:Art movements]]\n[[Category:Ism suffix]]"}}}]}}}}
