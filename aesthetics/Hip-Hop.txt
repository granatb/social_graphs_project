It has four key stylistic elements:\u00a0MCing/rapping,\u00a0DJing/scratching\u00a0with turntables,\u00a0break dancing (something that came about thanks to Brazilian immigrants of the time practicing their native martial art, Capoeira, out in the streets), and\u00a0graffiti/graff/writing, other elements include\u00a0sampling\u00a0beats or\u00a0bass lines\u00a0from records (or\u00a0synthesized beats and sounds), and rhythmic\u00a0beatboxing.\n\n\n\nWhile hip-hop has evolved considerably away from the streets of the Bronx, it has become perhaps the biggest genre of music in the world, welcoming any and all into its fold if they have the skills to stand out, even with the much-maligned \"Mumble Rap\" and \"Trap\" that is currently popular right now, the spirit of DIY that permeates Hip-Hop is alive and well in the new generation.\n\n== Visual ==\nA lot of Hip-Hop visuals share a lot in common with [[Urbancore]] aesthetics, with things like graffiti and urban neighborhoods showing up a lot in Hip-Hop visuals.  Among that, there's also nods to vinyl records, DJs, B-Boys/B-Girls, and elements of the original hip-hop, elements of gang culture like guns, drugs, women, alcohol, and death that accompanied the Gangsta rap era of hip-hop, and even the modern era where it seems to be all luxury item labels on everything; be it clothing, jewelry, cars, etc.\n\n== Fashion ==\nHip hop fashion has changed over the years, with the style now being more of a [[High End Streetwear]] look. Due to the 90's Revival, 80's, 90's and early 2000's hip hop looks have been coming back into style (this does not mean that modern hip-hop fashion is out of style, it is just more common). 70's, 80's, 90's and early 2000's hip hop fashion usually consisted of affordable, oversized clothes (for both men and women) because 1) they were always moving and needed to be comfortable all the time and 2) youth in the Bronx didn't have much control over where they lived, so fashion gave them lots of freedom; as we moved into the 2000s women began wearing more dresses and heels. Sneakers were common, but skate shoes and high top Doc Martens have been seen as well.  \n\nSuccessful rappers put lots of emphasis on jewelry and displayed their riches through \"iced out' rings, chains, and even on their teeth (grills). In the late 90s and early 2000s hip hop fashion became popular and recognized by high-end brands, it wasn't uncommon to see rappers wearing a brand name article of clothing and a plain pair of pants, or a fashionable pair of sneakers and a run-of-the-mill tracksuit. Hip hop fashion today tends to gravitate towards higher-end brands (e.g Nike) and sportswear-type outfits commonly found on the [[High End Streetwear|High-End Streetwear]] scene. A majority of the fashion stays baggy, breathable and fashionable. \n\n== Slang Words/Phrases ==\n* '''Homie/Home Boy/Homegirl''': A close friend.
