Different schools, museums, television programs, and children's toys utilize the aesthetic to inspire students to pursue science in the future. Because of this, many young children go through a phase in their life where they are obsessed with a subject such as dinosaurs or train engineering. Unfortunately, many of the efforts into kid science are marketed towards boys, but the subject is gender-neutral.\n\nIt emphasizes all fields, but paleontology, zoology, entomology, and astronomy are the most popular subjects. Because the children are not advanced enough to understand the basis of multiple subjects such as DNA or mathematics, great emphasis is put on imagination, memorization, and simple experiments that could be done at home. Teachers and exhibit designers seek to show students the scientific processes directly, with tours, pets, and movies. \n\n<br />\n\n== Visuals ==\n\n* Animal adaptations\n*Baking soda volcanoes\n* Bright block lettering\n* Butterfly and frog life cycles\n* Chemistry sets\n** Colorful liquids and density experiments are the most popular\n* Dangerous natural phenomenon such as volcanoes and earthquakes\n* Dinosaur battles\n* Educational video games such as [https://classic.animaljam.com/en Animal Jam]\n* Fossils stylized as whole pieces\n* Food science, such as rock candy\n*Fun facts related to the size, traits, and behavior of animals\n* Geodes and other attractive minerals\n* Personifications of organisms; they would introduce themselves to the reader/watcher\n* Physics applied to \"cool\" subjects like rollercoasters and car racing\n* Picture books\n* Rocket ships\n* Science museums\n* Scientists in white lab coats with quirky but approachable personalities\n* Tools such as telescopes and microscopes\n*Safety goggles and lab coats.\n\n<br />\n\n== Media ==\n\n=== TV Shows ===\n\n*''Bill Nye the Science Guy'' (1993)\n*Magic School Bus (1994)\n*Dexter\u2019s Laboratory (1996)\n* ''Dinosaur Train'' (2009)\n*''Wild Kratts'' (2011)\n\n=== Albums/DVDs ===\n\n* ''Science Rock'' by Schoolhouse Rock (1978)\n* ''Here Comes Science'' by They Might Be Giants (2009)<br />\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\n\nFile:Kid science museum.jpg\nFile:Kid science natgeo.jpg\nFile:Kid science experiments.jpg\nFile:Kid science fossils.jpg\n\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Science]]\n[[Category:Schools, bookstores, and libraries]]"}}}]}}}}
