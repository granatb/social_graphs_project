They were primarily distinguished by snappy, foreign clothing that contrasted heavily with the communist realities of the time. Clothing was often acquired from acquired from illegal traders called ''fartsovshchiks''. They were known for a fascination with\u00a0''zagranitsa'' (the real or imagined borders of an idealized western world), modern western music, and fashion corresponding with that of the Beat Generation. English writings on Soviet culture roughly translated the derogatory term to dandies, fashionistas, beatniks, hipsters, or zoot suiters.\n[[Category:Fashion]]\n[[Category:Needs work]]\n[[Category:Candidates for Deletion]]"}}}]}}}}
