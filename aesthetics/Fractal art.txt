It is a genre of computer\u00a0art\u00a0and digital\u00a0art.\n\nThe mathematical beauty of fractals lies at the intersection of generative art and computer art. They combine to produce a type of abstract art.\n== Visual ==\nFractal art is rarely drawn or painted by hand. It is usually created indirectly with the assistance of fractal-generating software, iterating through three phases: setting parameters of appropriate fractal software; executing the possibly lengthy calculation; and evaluating the product. In some cases, other graphics programs are used to further modify the images produced. This is called post-processing. Non-fractal imagery may also be integrated into the artwork. The Julia set and Mandelbrot sets can be considered as icons of fractal art.\n\n== Software ==\nFractal art is typically created with a piece of software. This includes:\n\n* Apophysis\n* Visions of Chaos\n* Electric Sheep\n* Mandelbulb3D\n\n== Notable Artists ==\n\n* Fractually the Fractal God (instagram is @fractually)\n* Hamid Naderi Yeganeh\n* [https://www.deviantart.com/fractaldesire/gallery FractalDesire] (DeviantArt)\n\n== Gallery ==\n''Under Construction''[[Category:Visual]]\n[[Category:Movement]]\n[[Category:Art]]\n[[Category:Needs work]]\n[[Category:Candidates for Deletion]]"}}}]}}}}
