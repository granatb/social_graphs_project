The participants of this aesthetic place a great importance on appreciation of the arts and the luxurious lives of the Italian nobility, such as in masked balls. The aesthetic is able to blend the cosmopolitan Renaissance cities of Florence, Rome, and Venice with the countryside. Luxury is also an important part of the aesthetic, as activities associated with the leisure class, such as buying luxury goods and frequent traveling, are frequent subjects of these photos. It often overlaps with [[Vintage Parisian]], but its regional focus, emphasis on [[Classicism]], and the addition of rural, almost [[Cottagecore]], stylings distinguishes it from its French counterpart.  \n\n<br />\n\n== Visual ==\n\n* Baroque, Pre-Raphaelite, and Renaissance styled paintings\n*Beaches and the ocean\n*Caf\u00e9s\n*Charcuterie platters\n*Designer fashion goods from Italian brands such as Prada and Gucci\n*Farms, fields, and forests of Italy\n*Fresh fruit such as figs, peaches, and grapes\n*Interiors of Italian palaces, cathedrals, and museums\n* Love-related media, such as quotes, plays, and books\n*Photos of runway details\n* Physically attractive men and women, sometimes nude\n*Romeo and Juliet themed imagery\n* Streets of Italian cities, such as Rome and Venice\n* Sunsets and sunrises\n*Vintage cars\n* White marble sculpture\n\n<br />\n\n== Fashion ==\n\n* White linen blouses\n* Off-the-shoulder tops\n* Loose, flowing skirts\n*Silk slip dresses\n* Haute couture gowns\n*Sandals\n*Patterned scarves, like Audrey Hepburn in ''Roman Holiday''\n* Delicate jewelry\n* Floral hair arrangements\n* Straw hats\n\n<br />\n== Activities ==\n\n* Boating in the Italian riviera\n* Going to historical cities and buildings\n* Picnicking\n* Reading poetry\n* Riding on a Venetian gondola\n* Shopping at a farmers market\n* Sketching daily life\n\n<br />\n\n== Media ==\n\n=== Movies ===\n\n* ''Call Me by Your Name'' (2017)\n*''Houseboat'' (1958)\n*''Letters to Julliet'' (2010)\n*''Made In Italy'' (2020)\n*''Much Ado About Nothing'' (1993)\n* ''Roman Holiday'' (1953)\n*''Romeo and Juliet'' (1968)\n*''Only You'' (1994)\n*''Three Coins in the Fountain'' (1954)\n*''The Lizzie McGuire Movie'' (2003)\n*''Under the Tuscan Sun'' (2003)\n*''Viola de mare'' (2009)\n*''Spring'' (2014)\n\n=== Books ===\n\n* ''Call Me by Your Name'' by Andr\u00e9 Aciman\n* ''Love & Gelato'' by Jenna Evans Welch \n*''Under the Tuscan Sun'' by Frances Mayers \n\n== Music ==\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery widths=\"185\">\nTemple.jpg\nVenice.jpg\nMuseum-couple-kiss-shadow-bust-sculpture.jpg\nVerona balcony.jpg\nJohn William Waterhouse.jpg\nFruit bread and cheese.jpg\nIrene brin.jpg\nColosseum-italian-picnic.jpg\nFile:Romantic italian fruits.jpg\nRomantic italian.jpg\nRose-fountain.jpg\nFile:Romantic italian dress.png\nAphrodite-adonis-sculpture.jpg\nFile:Romantic italian rome.jpg\nFile:Romantic italian illustration.jpg\nFile:Romantic italian garden.jpg\nIt's what's happening.jpg\nFile:Orange tree.jpg\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Needs work]]\n[[Category:Visual]]\n[[Category:Art]]\n[[Category:Feminine]]\n[[Category:Community Identified]]"}}}]}}}}
