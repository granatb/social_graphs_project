Technically the term Regency refers to a time period in British history, but it is commonly applied to the same time period in other countries, such as France, Russia, and the United States, because of the wide reach of the aesthetic. In the US, this time period is sometimes referred to as the Federalist Era.  {{Aesthetic|image1=Eavesdropping by Vittorio Reggianini.jpg|decade_of_origin=Regency era|key_colours=Pastels|key_values=Elegance, the arts|related_aesthetics=[[Classicism]]<br>\n[[Light Academia]]<br>\n[[Rococo]]<br>\n[[Romantic Academia]]<br>\n[[Victorian]]}}\n== History ==\nThe fashion and artistic design of the Regency era was heavily influenced by archeological finds. Ancient Greek clothing influenced women's fashion and design motifs from pottery and furniture were copied.\n\nThe Regency aesthetic experienced a revival in the early 1900s due to Kate Greenaway's illustrations in children's books, and much later in 2021 with the release of the Bridgerton Netflix series.<br />\n== Visuals ==\nRegency visuals are often focused on elegance and grace.\n\n* Tea cups\n* Balls/dancing\n* Feathers\n* Flowers\n* Gardens\n* Carriages\n* Letters\n* Pianoforte\n*Wedgewood pottery\n\n<br />\n== Fashion ==\n\n=== Women ===\nTraditional regency dresses are characterized by loose, gauzy skirts and an empire silhouette. They normally tend to be in pastels. Accessories include gloves, necklaces, bonnets, shawls/wraps, headpieces, parasols, and fans.                \n\n'''Brands'''                \n\n* [https://www.historicalemporium.com/search/?q=regency Historical Emporium]                \n* [https://www.shoplillou.com/ Lillou]                \n* [https://maisonamory.com/ Maison Amory]                \n* [https://recollections.biz/clothing/Regency.html Recollections]                \n\n=== Men ===\nMen's fashion included top hats, cravats, shirts with high collars, waistcoats, frock coats, tight fitting breeches, and riding boots.
