These subjects coincide with [[Theatre Academia]] in the form of musicals. Musical Academia is not strictly adherent to school curriculum, as self-teaching may be just as effective and valid within the aesthetic. \n\n== Visual ==\nVisuals for musical academia lie on a broad spectrum. This can include:\n* Album covers\n* Band/orchestra rooms\n*Broken drumsticks\n* Calloused fingers\n* CDs\n* Conductors' batons and wands\n*Crumpled pages of compositions\n*Dedication through tears\n*Dried roses from old performances\n*Empty band rooms\n*Folders of sheet music stacked on shelves\n* Guitar picks, violin bows, reeds. drum gels\n* Instrument cases\n* Metronomes\n*Micromanaging before shows to make sure everything is perfect\n* Microphones\n* Music books and music theory textbooks\n* Music education videos\n* Music stands\n* Musical instruments of any kind\n* Music scores, clefs, and other notation\n* Orchestra pits\n*Organized percussion closets\n*Pages of notes from judges\n* Pencils\n* Sheet music\n*Shiny keys of a new marimba\n*Stacks of totally not legal copies of sheet music\n* Tuners\n* Theaters/performance stages\n* Vinyl\n\n== Philosophy ==\nMusical Academia is open to interpretation, as it does not base itself on one genre of music. It can vary by culture and genre, as it is the education and knowledge of the music itself that is important to the aesthetic. Appreciation for all music is not necessary, as certain genres may be more appealing to an individual, in which case other music related aesthetics can be combined specifically for that person. For example, musical academia can be mixed with [[grunge]] to achieve an aesthetic similar to Kurt Cobain. \n\n== Music ==\nMusic Academia can be applied to a variety of music genres as previously stated. Although, traditionally, certain genres and songs are commonly used for practicing instruments and are well known to music students. Each instrument, family, style, and genre has its own list of standards that everyone who considers themselves a musician of that type must, or at the very least should, know how to play. For this reason, it is nearly impossible to compose a list of songs that encompass all of musical academia. The list of standards for someone who plays jazz vibraphone versus someone who sings opera is going to be different and so on. However there are some standards that most musicians know, whether or not they intend to play them. \n\nSongs/pieces include (but are not limited to):\n\n* Twinkle Twinkle Little Star\n* Heart and Soul by Hoagy Carmichael\n*Porgy and Bess by George Gershwin\n*Summertime by George Gershwin\n* Ave Maria by Franz Schubert\n* The Moonlight Sonata by Ludwig van Beethoven\n* Fur Elise by Ludwig van Beethoven\n* Clair De Lune by Claude Debussy\n*Beau Soir by Claude Debussy\n* Prelude and Fugue No. 1 in C Major by J.S. Bach\n* Wish You Were Here by Pink Floyd\n* Smoke on the Water by Deep Purple\n* Stairway to Heaven by Led Zeppelin\n* Doe-Re-Mi by Julie Andrews\n* April in Paris by Count Basie\n* Anything Phil Collins or John Williams\n*Second Suite in F by Gustav Holst\n*Fifth Nocturne by Maud Powell\n*O Virtus Sapientie Alio Modo by Hildegard von Bingen\n*Strange Fruit by Billie Holiday\n*Gloomy Sunday by Billie Holiday\n*My Funny Valentine by Stan Kenton\n*Heartaches by Al Bowlly\n*The Planets by Gustav Holst\n*Swan Lake by Tchaikovsky \n*Anything composed using Serialism\n*The Firebird by Igor Stravinsky\n*The Sorcerer's Apprentice \n\n== Fashion ==\nMusical Academia covers such a broad topic that it is difficult to limit to a certain dress code. Musical Academia can include anything from self taught musicians to band students and etc. Commonly associated with Musical Academia would be the fashion that one would wear to see or perform in a recital, concert, or other performance. \n\nStyles can include, but are not limited to:\n\n* Concert black\n* Deep lipstick\n* Long black socks\n* Marching shoes\n* Dark flats\n* Marching uniforms\n* Long black dresses\n* Slicked back hair\n* Blouses\n* Dress shoes\n* Suits with black shirts\n\n== Activities ==\n\n=== Sports ===\n\n* Figure skating/ice skating\n* Roller-skating/skate boarding\n* Ballet\n* Ballroom dancing\n* Dancing of any kind\n* Running\n* Gymnastics\n*Marching Band\n*Yoga\n\n=== Outings ===\n\n* Concerts\n* The theatre\n* The opera\n* Music stores\n* Parks and gardens (walk around and try to find musicians performing!)\n* Record shops\n*Go to a jazz club\n*Watch a marching show\n*Attend a symphony\n\n=== Crafts ===\n\n* Woodwork \n*Wrapping mallets\n* Painting\n* Graphic design\n* Metalwork\n* Creating your own instruments\n\n=== Other ===\n* Analyze music or lyrics\n* Annotating music scores\n* Busking\n* Create playlists with oddly specific themes\n*Cringe every time you walk into a music store and see \"I need more cowbell\" on a cowbell for sale\n* Decorate your instruments (Please be careful in doing this.)\n* Design album covers for yourself\n* Hyperfixate on a composer, musician, or band and learn all about them\n* Learn sheet music and TAB\n** Learn about music theory.\n** Read a music textbook\n* Learn about music history.\n*Learn Stairway to Heaven on guitar just to bother the owners of music shops\n* Listen to music\n** Broaden your musical horizons and listen to new or obscure genres.
