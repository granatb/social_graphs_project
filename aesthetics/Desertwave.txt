It is based around the dismal, muted earthy colours and themes of the desert. Animals or things that may be strongly associated with this aesthetic are: cactuses, camels, sand, stone, leather and more.\n\n== Subgenres ==\n\n=== American Desertwave ===\n'''American Desertwave''' is an aesthetic that can be described as a combination of [[Synthwave]] and [[Western]]. It focuses primarily on the deserts of the southwestern United States and Mexico, reptiles, and 80s new wave rock groups, such as Oingo Boingo, Talking Heads, and Wall of Voodoo. The fashion of American Desertwave includes elements of what most people thought of that particular area of the country at the time (lots of vests, sun-protecting hats, ponchos, and light, airy clothing that won't cause you to overheat due to the immense heat that deserts tend to have during the day).\n\nNotable motifs include Mexican blankets, reptiles (primarily iguanas), fire, the Southwestern US & Mexico, Mexican pirate radio, human skeletons, and imagery inspired by Dia de los Muertos. This subgenre was created by user Mixingitall.\n\n=== Cryptid Desertwave ===\nCryptid Desertwave is a crossover between desertwave and [[Cryptid Academia]]/[[Cryptidcore]] where the main focus is around Areas 51 and Roswell, New Mexico. This also includes regular desert visuals, as well as visuals that include UFOs, aliens, mini-vans, government facilities, and more.\n\n== Visuals ==\n* Sand\n* Stone\n* Cacti\n* Earth-based homes\n* Camels\n* Succulents\n* Leather\n* The sun\n* Vintage trailers/Airstreams\n\nThe colour palette encompasses colours like muted green, brown, darker yellow and creamy white.\n\n== Fashion ==\nBaseline fashion for desertwave should include comfortable, breathable, light clothing that protects from the sun.
