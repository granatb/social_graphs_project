It's more in line with the moment and thinking about the good memories than with any sort of material element. This is generally an aesthetic embraced by more extroverted individuals and doesn't have an ounce of cynicism behind it like most other aesthetics. The old MTV show Sifl & Olly would probably describe this particular aesthetic as \"crescent fresh\".\n\n== Visuals ==\nImportant elements of the Cuddle Party aesthetics include alcohol, weed, glowsticks, watching old cartoons until 3 in the morning, drunk girls telling you they love you while braiding your hair, and breaking into an old barn out of town in the dead of night with some good friends to just hang out and relax.\n\n== Fashion ==\nCuddle Party fashion tends to involve fluffy, soft clothing accompanied with piercings, stick-&-poke tattoos, worn out and dirty shoes from exploring with friends, poorly dyed and uneven hair (that is often done with friends), tacky thrift store clothing that has been worn out to the point of just being comfortable, and just anything that can remind people of the better times. Any colors can be associated with Cuddle Party, ranging from murkier colors (to represent a chilled-out mood), neon colors (to represent fun and parties), and pastels/grey tones (to represent genuine friendships).\n\n== Activities ==\n\n* Going to a carnival/fair\n* Eating cotton candy\n* Going to the arcade\n* Watching movies\n* Sleepovers\n\n== Resources ==\nExternal links to help get a better understanding of this aesthetic.\n\n=== Playlists ===\n\n* [https://open.spotify.com/user/rmyers99/playlist/0S2UQRljOIq68nVIZIKedg Cuddle Party 2.0 playlist by Rob Myers]\n* [https://open.spotify.com/user/122454412/playlist/5mrRFWfSkxHRNmvAihOh8J Digital Cuddle Party Vibes playlist by Josh Barnhart]\n* [https://open.spotify.com/user/goozalini/playlist/7m0esFkWVMYrSWXkiywTLs Cuddle Party playlist by Behrouz Kiamanesh]\n* [https://open.spotify.com/user/mcgurkcolin/playlist/26BP7htqgXPlSegIQWqjPW *Adult* cuddle party playlist by mcgurkcolin]\n* \n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" widths=\"130\">\nTumblr pt03ojcU9A1s7eamy 1280.png|Cuddle Party summed up in one image.\nTumblr pt0vsmVzLl1s7eamy 500.jpg\nTumblr pt0vsmf1AB1s7eamy 1280.jpg\nTumblr pt0vslUcc11s7eamy 400.gif\nTumblr pt0vskokzh1s7eamy 640.gif\nTumblr pt0vscdYgo1s7eamy 640.jpg\nTumblr pt0vsbWo2S1s7eamy 1280.jpg\nTumblr pt0vsb0IBg1s7eamy 1280.jpg\nTiktok-fashion.png\n2a94d649e50699d8193faed9ec9f8a5c.jpg\nTh (5).jpeg\nCute sweater.PNG\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Visual]]\n[[Category:Fashion]]\n[[Category:Music]]"}}}]}}}}
