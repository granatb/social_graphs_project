This aesthetic does not aim to romanticize, fetishize, or glorify illness or medical-related trauma but aims to act as a coping mechanism for those in need of it. \n\n==Visual==\nVisuals include (but not limited to):\n\n*Needles/syringes\n*IV bags\n*Hospital beds\n*Hospital wards\n*Blood, either by itself or interacting with another element of the image\n*Monitors\n*Pills\n\nA lot of Medicalcore images take common medical imagery and provide an artistic/aesthetic twist to them, usually reducing eye strain with light colors. Some Medicalcore elements overlap with [https://lolitafashion.fandom.com/wiki/Guro_Lolita guro lolita].\n\n==Fashion==\nMedicalcore fashion can take on a variety of appearances; surgical masks, hospital scrubs, nitrite/latex gloves, hospital gowns, lab coats, bandages, and various other medical gear (like stethoscopes, etc.), and are often in pastel colors. Band-Aids with Sanrio or other cutesy patterns are extremely popular. Some people choose to emulate the look of a sick patient with things like gas masks, eye patches, bruises (either self-inflicted or accidental), gauze and large bandages, and mobile IV bags.\n\n==Subgenres==\n===Sickcore===\n'''Sickcore '''is a sub-aesthetic of Medicalcore that focuses on a sickly look, such as dark circles, a red nose, or looking too pale/skinny.\n\n===Dentalcore===\n'''Dentalcore''' is an aesthetic that involves dental objects and anything dental related, like teeth, baby teeth (in a container or on a tray, sometimes on jewelry such as necklaces and earrings), brace/retainer molds and braces on teeth, etc.\n\nFor another approach, see [[Teethcore]].\n\n===Pukecore===\n'''Pukecore''' is an aesthetic seemingly created by tumblr user pukecore. While it's composed of many different subjects, the aesthetic as a whole remains easily identifiable. Pukecore is meant to evoke feelings of \"God, this is so bright and shiny that I feel like I'm about to throw up, but then after that I can just lay down on this soft blanket and play some Pok\u00e9mon until I feel better.\" Although there are a lot of cute and bright/glittery subjects, a dark undertone is present as well (like many aesthetics listed on this wiki). It doesn't necessarily relate to eating disorders (such as bulimia nervosa), but it can.  \n\n===Genetic Disease===\nThe Genetic Disease aesthetic is about coping with genetic diseases such as Down Syndrome and other similar conditions.
