It is characterized by an aesthetic dominated by slime related pop culture references, ranging from the Toxic Avenger, slime-time live, mountain-dew, and toxic waste.\u00a0Similar to [[Vaporwave]] and [[Seapunk]], this aesthetic is an integral part of the genre and characterizes the artists who dive into the\u00a0Slimepunk movement. Slimepunk music often times features heavy & distorted bass-lines and has emerged largely from a post-acid scene.\u00a0Slime-punk artists tend to have a more aggressive or corrosive ethos in combination with their music. While there is no specific slime-punk sound, the aesthetic is a common unifying factor, and most Slimepunk artists feature heavy sampling within their music.\n\n== Visual ==\nSlimepunk was popular among teens and tweens of the internet that was very similar to [[Seapunk]], but with more of a focus on slime; a substance made with borax, glue, and water, among other add ins including glitter, fake snow, shaving cream, beads, charms, and more. It has been popularized on social media sites like YouTube and Instagram.  Popular elements of Slimepunk at the time include:\n\n* Squishies\n* Slime\n* Acrylic Nails\n* Slime Shops\n* YouTube\n* Cute Accessories\n* DIY Crafts\n\n\n== Fashion ==\n[[File:Tumblr ns9yizfcNS1u184ygo1 500.jpg|thumb|220x220px]]\nSlimepunk is often described as Seapunk's darker twin, and to some extent that makes a lot of sense. Slimepunk brings us underground into a rat-infested and polluted sewer system. Some online commentators theorize that\n\nSlimepunk is a reaction to the pollution of the environment and poisonous media trends prevalent in the world today. There is little evidence to suggest this, and as such, I feel that this is merely an attempt at attributing a purpose to the movement, as opposed to a genuine statement of the Slimepunk manifesto. Depending on who you ask, Slimepunk doesn\u2019t even exist or rather\u2026it always existed. Slimepunk, much like it\u2019s Seafaring predecessor is rife with truisms and paradoxical statements.\n\n===Slimepunk Fashion Stores===\n*[https://www.yokaicandy.com/ Yokai Candy]\n\n== Music ==\nOne major aspect of the Slimepunk sound is deep and growling synth \nbasslines, generally with dripping sound effects and/or Acid-House influences. Some of the music approaches Acid-Tech in terms of sound but is distinct in its more atmospheric approach and loyalty to the overall Slimepunk themes of toxic waste and noxious sewer gas. Other Slimepunk music has none of these features but still exists within the movement. Slimepunk is based on aesthetic, and it is that aesthetic that ties all the different sounds together. Slimepunk the musical genre may not exist necessarily, but the movement definitely exists and musical representations of the core Slimepunk aesthetic can definitely be found.\n\n=== Slimepunk Artists ===\n* Bleep Bloop\n* Poison Ivory\n* LE1F\n* Sludge Junkies\n* Polymorphing\n* NastyNasty\n* Vandalaze\n* N3rgul\n* Tennis Rodman\n\n* PROPANE\n* PROKO\n* sadguru\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" widths=\"130\">\nBiohazardandradiationsign.png\nPlease-use-in-spread.jpg\nSlimepunk fashion.png\nTumblr pq1fbh0EKR1s7eamy 250.jpg\nTumblr pq1fbhTHo71s7eamy 250.jpg\nTumblr pq1fbhUhWC1s7eamy 250.jpg\nTumblr pq1fbhysPq1s7eamy 400.jpg\nTumblr p1hf35JObe1wvki9oo1 400.jpg\nTumblr pj6a30lj8v1we3o7jo9 250.gif\nTumblr pj6a30lj8v1we3o7jo2 250.gif\nTumblr pj6a30lj8v1we3o7jo1 r1 250.gif\nTumblr pj6a30lj8v1we3o7jo8 250.gif\nTumblr pj6a30lj8v1we3o7jo6 250.gif\nTumblr pj6a30lj8v1we3o7jo7 250.gif\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Punk Suffix]]\n[[Category:Visual]]\n[[Category:Fashion]]\n[[Category:Music]]"}}}]}}}}
