It developed independently of Norman's involvement, particularly starting as a fan network after the\u00a0publishing houses\u00a0ceased printing new paperback editions of the novels, allegedly due to the controversy and pressure from\u00a0feminist circles, and the Gor books went\u00a0out of print\u00a0in the late 1980s. It does not have a uniform following but encompasses different groups of varying views and practices.\n\n== Visuals ==\n''Under Construction''\n\n== Fashion ==\n[[Category:Written]]\n''Under Construction''\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\n\nFile:DzmQgqMWkAAwDgl.png\n\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Needs work]]\n[[Category:Sensitive Content]]\n[[Category:Sexy]]\n[[Category:Candidates for Deletion]]"}}}]}}}}
