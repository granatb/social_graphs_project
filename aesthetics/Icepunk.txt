It's been described as \"[[Seapunk]] in an ice age\". It's said the term originated with rapper Drrty Pharms in an interview with Mishka:\n\n<blockquote>Icepunk, like seapunk, is more of a meme than it is a genre. I released the first ever icepunk song in October of 2011, entitled \u25ee\u25ee\u25eeIce\u25eeQueen\u25ee\u25ee\u25ee. I wanted to mimic the numb, uncomfortable feeling of being cold\u2026.After the creation of seapunk, [Facebook groups] were flooded with posts proclaiming the death of witch house, posts antagonizing the seapunks and people claiming to have created the next meme genre. Most of the members of these groups felt excluded by seapunk, as best expressed by that image macro of a dolphin with the caption \u201cyou can\u2019t sit with us\u201d. I took it upon myself to become the messiah for those left behind by seapunk, creating my own Facebook group called i\u00a2spunk, which featured a lengthy, \u2018troll-statement\u2019 explaining how icepunk was going to be the next big thing\u2026</blockquote>\n==Music==\n\n[[File:Ghost Burqas - Virgin Myth ( ***ICEPUNK 2*** )|thumb|330x330px]]\nIn many ways, Icepunk music is very similar to seapunk in terms of content, but the music evokes more of a wintery vibe, like you're stranded in the middle of a blizzard and you're drunk and high as hell, and it tends to have more of an early-to-mid 90's R&B vibe compared to the more house influences of seapunk.
