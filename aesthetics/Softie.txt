It's popular among some young women on social media. It, alongside the [[E-Girl]] and [[VSCO|VSCO Girl]], has become incredibly popular on TikTok.

They are boys who are unafraid of showing off their sensitive and artistic sides with the clothing that they choose to wear. They have become one of the more known aesthetics, despite female counterparts typically being more popular. Softboys also have quite a negative reputation, related to the fact that some Softboys fake their soft sides. Among trans boys, Softboys typically have a bit of a different meaning and style and tend to be more genuine. The Softboy also has ties to the [[Art Hoe]]. Softboys have been said to be influenced by K-Pop.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n===Fashion===\nThe Softboy does appear to wear pastel colors (optional) but is also know to wear more muted but still darker tones. Otherwise, they adopt a similarly vintage-themed fashion style like their Softgirl counterparts. Can also wear things a Softgirl would wear.\n\n\n\n\n\n==Oceanboy==\n{{Aesthetic|title1=Oceanboy|image1=Ocean-boy.jpg|caption1=|other_names=Oce-boy, Ocean|decade_of_origin=2020|creator/s=|key_motifs=Water, Sailor colors/patterns, boat themed visuals|key_colours=Blue, white, navy, green|key_values=|related_aesthetics=[[Comfy/Cozy]]<br>[[E-Boy]]<br>[[Kawaii]]<br>[[VSCO]]<br>[[Blue]]<br>|related_media=|related_brands=}}The '''Oceanboy''' (''also known as Oce-boy'') aesthetic can be considered to be a more laid-back and easy-going type of the Softboy aesthetic, mixed with the [[Blue]] aesthetic. This is a color and environment-based aesthetic, focusing on oceans, light, and pastel cool-tone colors.\n\n===Visual===\nWhile Oceanboy tends to still use pastels from time to time, darker, cooler color palettes are preferred. Beaches, water, or docks are all common, but not essential.\n\n===Fashion===\nOceanboy tends to be a bit brighter than Softboy, as to really bring out the cooler colors. They opt for comfy, simple outfits that allow them to simultaneously look softer. \n\n== Resources ==\nExternal links to help get a better understanding of these aesthetics.\n\n=== Vendors ===\n\n==== Softgirl ====\n\n*[https://orezoria.com/ Orezoria]\n*[https://softgirloutfits.com/ Soft Girl Outfits]\n*[https://mysweetoutfit.com/ My Sweet Outfit]\n*[https://m.shein.com/us/Women-c-2030.html?url_from=musadgs09_cheapcloth02_20210123 SHEIN]\n*[https://shoptery.com/collections/soft-girl-clothes Shoptery]\n*[https://www.cosmiquestudio.com/collections/soft-girl-outfits Cosmique Studio]\n*[https://kawaiivibe.com/ Kawaii Vibe]\n\n===Playlists===\n\n==== Softgirl ====\n\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1J65wKV8DTjFVxyZBA2PIk?si=1a9a10391cd2480a Soft aesthetic songs] by miraya \u2601\ufe0f\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/51oeCLfYJXu9yehRCIUoOE soft girl vibez\ud83c\udf37\u2728 by kendallking]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5rH2j8RFq7JejA6gJlMl0E \ud83d\udc93Soft Girl Hours\ud83d\udc93 by gidget_05_02_16]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2Pt2rHfMtTH0gI9xXbKYvs soft girl energy\u2601\ufe0f by alexandraaaa]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7i7O9nmiwkuIG2AdNgibjZ soft girl anthems by Lauren Veldboom]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7BFHm9hWkhrGyFfSAgK3p1 softgirl\ud83c\udf37 by ashlee.robertsss]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/24yzIhyKt2fSPKf4uX13B0 softgirl szn by amandaxlucia]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4uQhIglVYTwsRYSirIMk5M Softgirl by sydniereed14]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4feW8odQcnBaqYAMSRpyWC Softgirl vibes by hildeneva2]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7AoREZMDR8ggMhjavlIKc4?si=VbVR3EkeSbGd7rE800onWQ uwu vibes by sleepyyjax]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jijvm8fIKGU This Is Home by Cavetown]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSXiNSiiCsg Falling For You by Peachy!
