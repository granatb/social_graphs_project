It is based around the idea of strip clubs and glow in the dark undergarments. The aesthetic glorifies the neon signage and back alley advertisements, as well as the glamorous interiors of these sorts of establishments.\n\nThis aesthetic is often associated with a wide variety of musical styles, but in the modern era, Rap, [[R&B]], [[Hip-Hop]] and Trap are most commonly associated with this aesthetic.\u00a0 Because of the color palettes and similar motifs, Stripcore shares a lot in common with [[Synthwave]], [[Vaporwave]], and [[Glowwave]], but with more of an adult spin than some of the aesthetics already feature.\n\n<br />\n== Visuals ==\nStripcore is often based around the general contrast of neon lights on black or strip club backgrounds. Bright neon colors (''such as: neon yellow, orange, red, pink, purple, and blue)'' commonly found on large strip club fronts are a noticeable aspect of Stripcore, as well as the back alley advertisement. Neon glowing glass usually found in strip club interiors is also a notable aspect of Stripcore.\n\nItems in the visual aspects of the Stripcore aesthetic can include:\n\n*Neon strip signs\n*Peep windows\n*Strip club interiors\n*Back alleys\n*Neon strip advertising\n*Strip club exteriors\n*Stripper poles\n\nThe Stripcore aesthetic may also include women performing within a strip club; something we will not be able to show on this Wiki for very obvious reasons.\u00a0 As far as after hours go, the Stripcore aesthetic may have unfortunate crossovers into [[Drugcore]] territory (though it should be noted that this won't ALWAYS be the case with Stripcore; a lot of these ladies do like to keep it clean, after all, and are just doing their job).\n<br />\n== Fashion ==\nStripcore fashion is incredibly skimpy and can borrow heavily from both the [[Raver]] aesthetic (especially with the Raver festival wear that they'll often wear to outdoor festivals) and the [[Cosplay]] aesthetic (after all, these ladies are in the business of selling a fantasy).\u00a0 In terms of make-up, a lot of [[Glowwave]] or even [[Rainbowcore|Chroma Chameleon]] can show up due to their inherently flashy and eye-catching nature, and what better way to catch the eye of customers than with flashy, eye-catching make-up and clothing.\u00a0Stripcore items include:\n\n*Lingerie\n*Neon undergarments\n*Neon clothing\n*Neon lingerie\n*GITD (''glow in the dark)'' clothing\n*GITD lingerie\n*Spikes and studs\n*Glowsticks\n*Body glitter\n\n<br />\n\n== Music ==\nStripcore music is designed with one goal in mind; to replicate the vibe within a strip club.\u00a0 Sometimes the music is about the boys going out to the strip club to spend lots of money on the girls or are sometimes just a glorification of strippers as a whole.\n\n===Spotify Playlists===\n\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1p5ATkl3wDxrdRUMcLVWEj?si=B-DAdCUnTSejZM_4NAfOHA Strip club music.]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0d1RPJy1FgCVR3lFhrYAwU?si=8lJn47JeTkiQ55DPQk5IVw Strip club 2020 \u2b50\ufe0f] \n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4sAcleULNT3s1WSfZtUZvx?si=v5MF2CTgTGK0dutaLW8lCQ Strip club anthems]\n*[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7tuVUPEWG1VyfdBlSHcKnV?si=q3IraIKxSgaZcBTnc4al7Q Strip club music \ud83c\udf51]<br />\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery orientation=\"landscape\" widths=\"135\">\n\nStrip club back alley.jpg\nStrip club poles.jpg\nStrip club interior.jpg\nStrip Club Pole.jpg\nDarker strip club interior.jpg\nBarcelona Strip club interior.jpg\nPussy's Strip club front.jpg\nA13e80e8489ced0ac5298efbe22049a0.jpg\nScreen Shot 2020-08-17 at 12.24.56 am.png\nB264d535465f8b21d85493f92b83e15e.jpg\nC2c2821f89888c458f5984a1849c6e26.jpg\nFbf20bb76cd9c0fafcbcb86333b89f8a.jpg\nCd2132c5ecd7dbdc420d6e260622ec00.jpg\nFfba21c37320ed2768bd8883ae5e69c3.jpg\nFile:Stripcore moodboard c.png\n\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Visual]]\n[[Category:Core Suffix]]\n[[Category:Fashion]]\n[[Category:Music]]\n[[Category:Vacation, amusement, and recreation]]\n[[Category:Sexy]]"}}}]}}}}
