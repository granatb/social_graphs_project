While its origins can be traced back to the 1990s/80s, it appears the aesthetic is a nostalgia-based creation of the 2010s.\n\n==Visual==\nCommon motifs in Kidcore visuals are bright colors frequently used on children's toys, most frequently highly saturated versions of the traditional primary colors (red, yellow, and blue), playgrounds, stuffed animals such as Beanie Babies and TY, robot pets like Furbies, Lisa Frank artwork, rainbows, and other kid themes. Other common themes involved in Kidcore include:\n*Bedtime stories\n*Books\n*Colorful bookshelves\n*Watercolors and detailed linework\n*Rabbits and mice\n*Alphabet blocks\n*Games Cupboard\n*Balloons\n\n==Fashion==\nKidcore fashion is typically colorful and highly saturated, and predominantly utilizes the traditional primary colors, but it does sometimes include neutrals, secondary colors and pastels. Fashion pieces include: \n\n*Collared shirts\n*Light-up shoes, old sneakers\n*Denim overalls (preferably short)\n*Tee-shirts of kids shows/simple patterns/animals\n*Striped socks, stockings, or knee/ankle-high socks\n*Denim shorts/jeans adorned with stickers/glitter\n*Puffy sleeves\n*Overalls or suspenders\n*High-tops\n*Baseball tees\n*Jeans\n*Pajamas\n*Earrings\n*Friendship necklaces\n*Bandages\n*Kandi\n*A stuffed animal/plushie\n*Temporary tattoos\n*Slap on bracelets\n*Rainbow loom\n*Stickers\n\n==Architecture==\nThe architectural variants of kidcore - known as \"Wonka Post-Modern\", or \"Memphis Jr.\" due to it being inspired by the 1980s Memphis aesthetic - predate the rest of the genre, and can be said to have inspired the 2010s popularity via nostalgia. Examples typically come from theme parks and stores which market goods to children such as Toys 'R' Us and Gymboree.\n\n==Music==\n\n*Kero Kero Bonito - \"I'd Rather Sleep\"\n*\"PoPiPo\" - Hatsune Miku\n*\"It\u2019s a Kids World\" - Masafumi Takada\n*\"Two time\" - Jack Stauber\n*\u201cBleach Blonde Baby\u201d - Poppy\n*\u201dI\u2019m Poppy\u201d - Poppy\n*\u201cTurn The Lights Off\u201d - Tally Hall\n*\u201dFlamingo\u201d - Kero Kero Bonito\n*\u201dDead Sea Monkeys\u201d - Lemon Demon\n*\u201cdumb dumb\u201d - Mazie \n*\u201cEverybody Likes You\u201d - Lemon Demon\n*\u201dTouch-Tone Telephone\u201d - Lemon Demon \n*\u201cBlow My Brains Out\u201d - Tikkle Me\n*\u201cIcicles\u201d - The Scary Jokes\n*\u201dOut the Ox\u201d - Jack Stauber \n\n===Playlists===\n====[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6sLDsfI2H30dt35zFiVkAG?si=f185fd90b1b247ce Official Aesthetics Wiki Spotify playlist]====\nThe Aesthetics Wiki staff creates official Spotify playlists for aesthetics, which compile the songs most frequently featured on existing playlists dedicated to those aesthetics.
