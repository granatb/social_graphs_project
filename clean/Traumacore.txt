page but may contain disturbing things please avoid this article s comments section if this topic troubles you traumacore is a type of imagery that delves into the themes of abuse and trauma particularly sexual trauma or csa though it s not strictly limited to physical or sexual abuse mental emotional and spiritual abuse are also common themes as it pertains to traumacore it often draws heavily on childlike and angelic themes done so as a means to try and reclaim their innocence traumacore in general tends to be more focused on trauma experienced in childhood although adult trauma can also be covered many people turn to these images to help them cope with the pain they suffered in the past while many people say traumacore isn t inherently an aesthetic many of the images used in its photo or video edits are derived from other aesthetics traumacore is more of a type of art therapy or visual journaling for many people with trauma it is worth noting that some people who have went through trauma and use traumacore have stated that traumacore is an aesthetic albeit a special kind of aesthetic while others state that it isn t since those without trauma may try to romanticize the experiences of traumatized individuals whether it s an aesthetic or not it s notable enough to be on this wiki it is frowned upon to participate in traumacore if the participant is not a survivor of some kind of trauma themselves as it is considered fetishization of a very serious issue trauma consumes many people s lives traumacore can be of use as a coping mechanism for those who need it however like any kind of coping mechanism it should not be a stand in for proper treatment like therapy or medication many traumacore edits have negative words or phrases in them ex i am broken i will never be clean you used me rotten child please stop you ruined me which reflects on the creator participant s feelings about themselves and their experiences having a way of getting these thoughts out onto a screen or paper can be helpful as it puts feelings into a visual form that is easier to understand the morute aesthetic is the clearest predecessor of traumacore and as the aesthetic declined traumacore became the more popular aesthetic before the advent of naming aesthetics with the suffix core academia etc in the early to mid the tumblr community found their aesthetics through combining various tags such as creepy cute vintage etc with morute being a later name the aesthetic was popular and even possibly based on the female music artist nicole dollanganger who is not as emphasized in today s traumacore community the aesthetic had the same premise of traumacore users would contrast delicate and sweet imagery with dark subject matter relating to depression suicide eating disorders child sexual abuse religious abuse and abusive relationships however multiple tropes associated with traumacore today were largely absent sanrio edits and weirdcore imagery did not appear and there was more explicit material such as gore the aesthetic also differed slightly from modern traumacore in that it utilized more medical horror southern gothic and victorian imagery such as medical instruments and textbooks disturbing larvae and butterfly like monsters conjoined twins and daguerreotypes horror movie imagery such as ouija boards female ghosts porcelain dolls and serial killer dressed men standing ominously was also popular and the best way to describe the aesthetic is victim of a horror movie villain a lot of this overlapped with cult party kei a fashion that spread to america at that time traumacore draws upon a delicate childlike but implicitly disturbing aesthetic and aims to blend the unsettling with the innocent dolls angels bedrooms and corpses are common motifs used there is often a contrast between the imagery and the text in a traumacore visual for example one might put a disturbing message under a photo of a porcelain doll or a character from children s media many of those who enjoy traumacore are also fond of the rotting aesthetic imagery of bugs dirt and mold are often incorporated to represent this theme it is also common for traumacore aesthetics to reference religious themes such as crosses angels and mentions of heaven or hell traumacore aesthetics are generally soft or girlish though this is not always the case for example male followers of traumacore tend to employ more masculine colors and themes many traumacore edits also include nostalgic imagery as people s trauma happens very often during childhood some examples of this are sanrio characters like hello kitty children s bedrooms playgrounds and other places and things relevant to childhood happycore is the supportive version of this aesthetic it uses images to

dancinggrowing flowers in one s gardenconsuming media targeted at children video games anime manga deus ex tv shows etc one of the main arguments against traumacore is its romanticization and aestheticization of mental illness and abuse in depicting depression eating disorders sexual abuse etc as beautiful concepts people who appreciate the aesthetic may seek out these kinds of experiences which would endanger their health and invalidate the experiences of people who are traumatized and would not want anyone to mimic their experience for people who have been traumatized traumacore imagery can cause people to center their identity around these negative emotions and hinder attempts at recovery and developing a personality beyond what they were like while experiencing trauma different visuals can also trigger the viewer into past behaviors because of the desire for beauty such as survivors of eating disorders relapsing after being constantly exposed to images of small and delicate girls an issue within the traumacore community is cross tagging which is the act of adding non trauma related hashtags to traumacore posts this can be very dangerous as it allows for people to stumble across triggering posts without deliberately searching for them it has been said not to add sanrio related tags on traumacore posts because kids and people who are not comfortable with seeing traumacore imagery may be scrolling through these topics if you post or repost any traumacore content please use only traumacore related tags and refrain from using unrelated tags such as sanrio aesthetic pastel etc another issue within the community is art theft this includes reposting edits with no credit reposting edits with improper credit writing simply credits to the artist creator claiming others works as one s own or reposting using others work in edits without permission when reposting traumacore edits art first make sure the original artist allows reposts then clearly type their username in the post description this allows people to know who made an edit every time it gets reposted related if you know the creator s of any of the images in our gallery please
