ocean grunge is a music centric aesthetic that is considered the darker version of seapunk that started in it takes a lot of the elements from it and vaporwave but has a darker air and color palette applied to it than the usually colorful palette associated with the other two for its visual medium in exchange for a more restricted color palette of blacks greys and muted blues the music itself takes a lot of inspiration from early vaporwave drone nu metal and grunge and does have some similarities to witch house but while witch house has more of a spooky and ethereal air to it ocean grunge tends to be hollow and depressing but still carries the ocean sea motif its cousin genre carries ocean grunge aesthetics can also tap into the aesthetics of the deep ocean including sunken ships and the aquatic creatures of the deepest darkest parts of the ocean abyss both realistic and surreal if ocean grunge happens to take a trip under the sea however a lot of yellows whites blacks and dark blues and purples create a slightly richer color palette ocean grunge tends to borrow a lot visuals from seapunk but rather than the rich vibrant colors one often sees associated with that particular genre it tends to be more monochromatic utilizing lots of blacks greys and muted blues these colours reflect the cold dark deep empty feeling one would feel being stranded in the middle of the ocean with no land in sight and slowly losing all hope of rescue coming to save you before ultimately plunging into the ocean depths below musically ocean grunge has a tendency to have a droning melancholic sound to it much like regular grunge and has a heavy element of nihilism to its overall aesthetic like when one first reads on the philosophy of friedrich nietzche and really hasn t taken into account the nuances associated with such a philosophy musicians in the genre include how to make ocean grunge poseidon in chains e f d g hyperchrist interferencenouveau dossierkieriouschichilcitlalli by colin fullerposeidon by lilyocean soundboard by kim s spotifyocean grunge by chichilcitlalli x atmpk calmly waiting at the bottom of the sea ocean grunge music tends to be ambient in nature and while earlier examples of ocean grunge incorporated samples of grunge music it has involved to incorporate elements of orchestral and dark synth pop music as well examples of this newer style of ocean grunge music include kurzgesagt original motion picture soundtrack by epic mountainabz√ª gaming music cryo chamber s dark water ambient playlistocean grunge has been incorporated by artists for food presentation the use of ocean grunge has been observed with food preparations of seafood and desserts
