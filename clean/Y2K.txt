music and furnishings shining with tech optimism sometimes literally according to the aesthetic institute some of its aspects include tight leather pants silver eyeshadow shiny clothing oakleys gradients and blobitecture most aesthetics rely on the use of technology and slick futuristic looks signaling the optimism of a new era as the century millennium progressed into the century millennium one of the earliest definers of the aesthetic is the designers republic a sheffield based graphic design studio best known for their work on the wipeout video game franchise and various album artwork the era ended in late and was succeeded by the frutiger aero and mcbling era aesthetics could ve possibly been inspired by other previous futuristic aesthetics such as retro futurism some elements of especially from the earlier portion of the era would also cross over into the vaporwave aesthetic since it shares vaporwave s angst towards late stage capitalism and its nostalgic desire to retreat into a retrofuturist world promised before western society entered its current troubled times however the aesthetic has not yet been explored by the vaporwave scene as much as earlier more ubiquitous periods like the early neon synthwave aesthetic first major signs of the aesthetic appeared around to with the release of windows the movie hackers the game wipeout and music videos by artists such as michael and janet jackson scream puff daddy mo money mo problems will smith gettin jiggy wit it men in black and the spice girls say you ll be there being done in this style the era then took off in full force from to with things such as pokemania limp bizkit nsync trl the matrix and britney spears hitting their peak popularity replaced the core era which had been known for its darker more serious tone with aesthetics such as grunge peaked around late early coinciding with the turn of the millennium and apex of the dot com bubble the era gradually declined from to as the contentious u s presidential election the dot com bubble bursting the anthrax scares and the iraq war dampened optimism for the new millennium it finally ended in late after which it gave way to the mcbling and frutiger aero aesthetics although not as popular these days culture can still be seen in various circles of the internet and niche entertainment but is starting to see a bit of a resurgence in its imagery in pop culture as late early nostalgia has started coming back in fashion such as in by charli xcx by anne marie and motivation by normani ivy hollivana dear deathwaters perhaps the future of the sound aesthetics use both and art art usually features thick lines bold minimalism and heavy use of iconography art is more blobby looking has more gradients and generally looks very shiny common colors used in art are but not limited to chrome icy blue ocean bright oranges glossy white and black for lineworks one of the most well known faces of art is the designers republic known for their works on the video game series wipeout as well as various album artwork especially for artists on the electronica label warp records founded by ian anderson and nick phillips in they were best known for making art that subverts brash consumerism and the uniformity of corporate culture similar to what vaporwave has done since then like vaporwave much of their work also drew inspiration from japanese anime which was beginning to rise in popularity around the same time being that this was the era that the cell phone was first starting to become popular among your average consumer you can find a lot of nods to the original models of cell phones such as the original nokia phones or the clamshell flip phones within the subculture also popular around this time was the blobject a type of design product often a household object distinguished by smooth flowing curves bright colors and an absence of sharp edges the word is generally held to be a portmanteau a contraction of blob and object blobitecture also known as blobism is a term given to a post modern architectural style characterized by curved and rounded building shapes or blob architecture blobitecture buildings appear to have an organic form that is soft and free flowing yet comes together to produce a complex whole blobitecture buildings started popping up around the late s early to reflect a lot of the trends at the time giving the buildings something of a futuristic look at the time by the standards of what constituted futuristic at that time period is a very new concept but with certain brands that were popular at the time still existing one could easily predict these brands could potentially play a huge role in basically you d either look like a late early raver or a member of a boy band from the time also it should be noted a lot of holosexual aesthetics and style can turn up in fashion as well due to its usage in futuristic fashion at the time early commercials a compilation of themed commercials

nintendo sega saturn gameboy color also contained early elements of bridging the core into the era during the late and early sega had attempted to make one last console before they went out of business the dreamcast released in had shown sega s ability to make creative and innovative games the most esque game was space channel a rhythm game intended for a casual female audience that was applauded for its retro art style and soundtrack encapsulating a lot of what people admired about aesthetics another dreamcast game that could be considered inspired is s jet set radio which while not having the slick designs of space channel captured other aspects such as japanese punk fashion and early hip hop jet set radio would also use iconography inspired graphics for its ui jet set radio future its sequel integrated even more aesthetics into its art and gameplay yet more sega games that embodied this aesthetic are sonic adventure sonic adventure and sonic heroes particularly with its janky yet charming visuals and atmospheric music on the sony end of the spectrum no game series does a better job of embodying the aesthetic than the wipeout series with art done by the aforementioned designers republic even with recent iterations like wipeout hd and wipeout ace combat electrosphere also used a futurism aesthetic in its user interface fictional aircraft designs and soundtrack other companies attempted to use aesthetics as a promotion for consoles controllers and games recently the indie game scene started to get inspired by the revival wave and the developers to revisit the aesthetic one of the first games is crossniq a puzzle arcade game mimicking the dreamcast puzzles made by max kriegler and the upcoming bombrush cyberfunk and neon white ivy hollivana breaking point since was about embracing the future the tone of music also reflected this electronic music was the go to genre to capture this era as a musician the most well known music associated with is big beat a subgenre of electronic music that used heavy breakbeats and synthesizer generated loops and patterns bands such as the prodigy fatboy slim the crystal method junkie xl and propellerheads performed this music during the however the genre has since become less prevalent in the mainstream with modern examples being few and far in between other genres used during the era were jungle drum n bass and trance much like big beat and what ultimately inspired big beat to begin with these genres have a heavy emphasize on techno style music with fast beats and use of synthesizers to this day these genres are still used in edm scenes all over bubblegum eurodance was also common during the era aqua the band responsible for the hit barbie girl is often attributed as being the most popular example of this genre with an honorable mention going to eiffel known for their single blue da ba dee the aesthetic can also be seen in the music video to the red hot chili peppers californication the video takes the

into the bling shiny suit jiggy era many hip hop artists used aesthetics in music videos such as tlc in their no scrubs video though on the aesthetics institute there is a lyrics video for an artist
