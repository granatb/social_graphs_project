weirdcore is an online aesthetic and art movement centered around amateur or low quality photography and or digital graphics that have been constructed or edited to convey feelings of confusion disorientation alienation and nostalgia or anemoia visually it is strongly influenced by the general look and feel of images shared on an older internet roughly a period spanning from around the late s to mid s amateur editing primitive digital graphics lo fi photography and image compression are some of the most common elements found in weirdcore images thematically weirdcore often conveys a feeling of dread brought forth by its low quality imagery and a lack of context in regards to the location or the message being shown this does not mean that weirdcore is deeply rooted in horror however as the feeling of fear left on the viewer is merely a side effect of placing them in an unfamiliar setting or context this is purely subjective however and depends on the viewer their own experiences and the content of an edit while some people might find a weirdcore image scary or ominous others might feel nostalgia or even a feeling of comfort the amateur or lo fi photography is one of the most common elements in weirdcore these are often liminal spaces an aesthetic that weirdcore has a strong connection to and often relies on but the use of them is not obligatory the virtual part of an image often but not always manifests itself in the form of plain looking text which conveys a message that is incomplete or out of context thus leaving the viewer to ask questions and make their own interpretations in regards to the meaning of the statement presented to them keep in mind that text is not a necessary part of weirdcore it is important to know however that both of these portions of weirdcore do not need to be present simultaneously to make a good image for example a weirdcore image may be constructed exclusively out of virtual elements and could still be categorized as such the same applies to amateur lo fi photography but regardless of how the process of creating weirdcore is approached the images should still aim to put the viewer in an unfamiliar and occasionally somewhat hostile context currently the exact origins of weirdcore are unknown but may go as far back as the early it has recently been determined that the earliest weirdcore edit with a confirmed date of creation was made in but there could be earlier examples out there that remain unknown the genre started to pick up popularity when a youtuber by the name of davidcrypt uploaded a video explaining the weirdcore aesthetic whilst there are popular weirdcore creators it is often hard to find the most popular or the origins of the content and creators as most current weirdcore content is uploaded to tumblr which doesn t show follower counts artists games resources blogs youtube channels lawgsanfor
