is not much media related shows or movies that showcase the pastel academia aesthetic as pastel academia since this is currently a new subculture slice of life anime is an excellent example of a genre that usually presents pastel academia ideals and values tv shows and movies like scream queens and the grand budapest hotel represent pastel academia as well though from a more visual perspective again you do not need to like or enjoy every single movie tv show anime or piece of music that is mentioned as long as you can appreciate and like the visuals of pastel academia as well as the values this subculture has to offer you re good to go pastel academia style music involves lots of girl boy bands lo fi soft ballads soft pop and musical soundtracks from childhood movies pastel academia is an inclusive subculture where academics don t or shouldn t care about what language the music they listen to is in as long as it sounds okay mitskilana del reymelanie dreheizeporter robinsonowl citydodiechevysnail s housethe two main aspects in almost every aesthetic is the ideals personality and the visuals clearing up misconceptionsthere could be controversy in the future about this aesthetic being too childish to the point where people label it as infantilising in no way shape or form is the intention of this aesthetic to attract or entertain pedophiles or imitate children there is a huge difference between enjoying what society labels as childish things and infantilising yourself to entertain adults pastel academia stands for people who never or rarely got to experience being young even if it s a time in their life they miss whether it s part of their personality or something that was developed throughout their life due to their environment the innocence of this aesthetic is solely to give those people a safe space where they can express their love for studying arts literature and much more while standing up to people who tell them to act their age just because they are passionate about certain things like going on picnics pastel colours and collecting things that make them happy there is no place in this community for individuals who infantilize themselves for the pleasure of pedophiles incels and others respect inclusivitythe pastel academia subculture is inclusive of people from all walks of life any race gender sexuality and spirituality are welcomed here people who marginalise and discriminate against other people are not welcomed in this subculture by any means respect is the number one ideology of this subculture we do not associate with people who claim to be of this subculture but chose to harm and inflict any kind of disrespect onto others for any reason we aren t immature in the sense that we act like children but in our interests and hobbies personalityas mentioned before the pastel academia aesthetic focuses on people who are more child like at heart they are usually optimists whose strength is that they often think creatively and outside of the box this makes them academically suited for studies like literature and the arts however they don t have to be confined to just those subjects in particular they love giving and occasionally craft gifts for their loved ones in a relationship they are caring and loving toward the other person people they are also quite spiritual despite their child like tendencies they are always searching for meanings to things due to their curiosity through religion or any other practice this also drives them to philosophy external links to help get a better
