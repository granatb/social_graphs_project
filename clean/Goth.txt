other dark media does not automatically make you goth being into gothic architecture settings or designs doesn t make you automatically goth either this is instead called gothic it is however referenced a lot in the music so being into dracula or the invisible man might expand your knowledge on the lyrical content goth in and of itself is not a kink subculture a goth who is into bdsm varies from individual to individual just like any other regular person as such a goth who is into bdsm or is a sex worker is worthy of the same respect as is any other partner consent is important a goth being dressed promiscuously is not an invitation for you to ask if they are into sex and bdsm yes there are goths who hate the big tiddy goth girlfriend memes too some do not find it cute at all also there exists goths on the asexual aromantic spectrum too don t assume every goth is into sex at all to begin with people who dress in goth outfits are not inviting you to sexually harass them the fact that this has to even be said is massively disappointing because some people need to hear this too you don t need the goth label to fit in or be cool either if you don t like goth music that s totally fine you don t need labels to identify yourself as you the individual are cool enough similarly its ok if you like goth music but don t want the label this applies to any other alternative subculture too by the way this article goes off on unneeded tangents that other aesthetic articles don t could be compressed a bit external links to help get a better understanding of this aesthetic
