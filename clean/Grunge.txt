grunge is a darker edgier style that is usually depicted these days with glitches vinyl records cigarettes neon lights and the color black which has absolutely nothing to do with the original grunge grunge historically though has its roots in the hard rock scene of seattle washington it was a countercultural anti consumerism youth movement and musical genre that defined generation x grunge fashion was made popular by bands like nirvana pearl jam alice in chains and soundgarden and was meant to be timeless and quite casual grunge started in with green river s album come on down but it did not become mainstream until the with nirvana s nevermind grunge was most popular from roughly to and eventually lost its anti consumerist philosophy it can be argued that grunge began to decline in after the tragic suicide of nirvana frontman kurt cobain though the genre maintained popularity until about when soundgarden broke up and post grunge bands like creed became popular a majority of grunge s visuals involve a large amount of dirty grimy imagery these show a sort of hopelessness and disenchantment with modern society a lot of earth tones and pale colors are used to convey this sort of cultural depression often associated with grunge grunge fashion of the late and early mid was often purchased out of thrift stores at the time some will argue it was done out of a rejection of the fashions of the time it s generally agreed that it s because it was cheaper as at the time most grunge artists were dirt poor as the fashion became more mainstream editor of men s magazine details james truman was quoted in to me the thing about grunge is it s not anti fashion it s unfashion punk was anti fashion it made a statement grunge is about not making a statement which is why it s crazy for it to become a fashion statement men often wore over sized t shirts flannel shirts that would be tied off around the waist when it got too hot ripped jeans and combat boots these were considered timeless looks and were generally durable and reliable clothing to wear women tended to favor slip dresses flannel shirts ripped jeans chokers and the bell bottoms babydoll t shirt was a popular combination as well it went out of fashion after kurt cobain s suicide but has started coming back into fashion in the and as nostalgia began an argument could be made this is what has led to the rise in prominence of vaporwave as well this trend began to regress as starts to become more and more prominent only to cycle back in another years as all trends seem to but with the modern grunge movement the philosophical elements of the original grunge movement were completely dropped in favor of just achieving the visual aesthetic of looking grunge although often paying far more exorbitant amounts of money compared to the original grunge style icons who almost exclusively shopped at thrift stores for more feminine edgy fashion however there was also the kinderwhore aesthetic popularized by courtney love who was kurt cobain s wife nirvana smells like teen spirit official music video the music video that started a revolution and ended a lot of careers while the fashion has certainly come back into style the music doesn t seem to have the same comeback which was a blend of heavy metal sound and punk rock ethos however after kurt cobain s suicide grunge started to trail off into two separate genres post grunge which included bands like creed nickelback staind puddle of mudd bush and the foo fighters fronted by former nirvana drummer dave grohl and nu metal which included bands like korn limp bizkit deftones kid rock papa roach p o d and linkin park the grunge revival has led to the old staples of the original grunge scene to see a return to popularity but as of this writing it has not led to any new grunge bands rising up the ranks but not for lack of trying artists in the genre include nirvanapearl jamalice in chainssoundgardenstone temple pilotsgreen year bitchtemple of the dogmudhoneymalfunkshunmother love boneholethe gitstitle fightfangclubmilk teethmuskets soft grunge resources vendors playlists pinterest boards grunge indie by nick grunge by grunge outfits by tessaaaaaagrunge outfits by nat and grunge outfits by harper mcintyre
