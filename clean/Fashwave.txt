please note that this page exists for the purposes of documentation not promotion due to the role the nazi party played in history and the subsequent sensitive and offensive nature of this aesthetic it is not recommended that you adopt it for yourself but if you do be prepared to be openly mocked and ridiculed aesthetics wiki does not endorse nazi ideology but it is important to acknowledge its impact on modern culture fashwave a portmanteau of the terms fascism and wave is a derivative aesthetic of synthwave or vaporwave that is associated with alt right far right dissident right beliefs like upholding tradition maintaining racial purity anti semitism ultranationalism and a rejection of post modernist thought which a lot of the modern aesthetics on this wiki are actually examples of it s not unusual for people from the fashwave scene to try and assimilate into the more mainstream synthwave or vaporwave scenes but they are often sniffed out pretty quickly and given the boot because nobody wants to associate with actual neo nazis fashwave is just an extension of the alt right an amalgamation of various far right groups such as neo nazis neo confederates skinheads nothing to do with the skinheads aesthetic white nationalists white supremacists and other like minded individuals in an attempt to establish a wholly white ethnostate by any means necessary though they ll never actually admit it because they know their actual worldview is highly unpopular these days for more information on how the alt right operate please check out the video in the gallery below entitled the alt right playbook how to radicalize a normie it s a long video but it can really show how they re able to recruit otherwise normal people and highlights why they decided to create fashwave as well as infiltrate the cottagecore community fashwave art takes the overall visual aesthetics associated with synthwave and vaporwave and combines them with symbols often associated with white nationalism white supremacy and fascism what can make fashwave more intricate however is the fact it can be claimed to be done ironically taking cues from the ambiguity often associated with vaporwave when people don t buy the irony argument they try to hide it by using more subtle imagery that laypeople may not necessarily know are neo nazi symbols such as the schwarze sonne which you can see in some of the images featured on this page including the infobox image on the right the iron cross the stands for the words a popular white supremacist slogan and the stands for hh or heil hitler the rounded celtic cross the ss lightning bolts the echos a set of parenthesis that they ll often use in reference to jewish people and ancient runic symbolism as well as utilizing phrases such as reject modernity embrace tradition blut und ehre german for blood honor and the words proper we must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children or the less common because the beauty of the white aryan woman must not perish from the earth for more information on potential symbology often used by members of the fashwave scene or the alt right in general please refer to this useful page provided by the adl while the original nazis had ties to hugo boss and coco chanel style icons of the time and chanel itself has only become more popular as time has progressed the fashwave crowd doesn t really have an established fashion style and will often look normal and unassuming if not a bit dapper in some instances like with richard spencer the man who coined the term alt right who appeared to be a respectable white nationalist until he was recorded during a particularly unhinged rant about jewish people and all enemies to the alt right there could be considered some crossover into the incel community since often times members of fashwave or other alt right communities will reach out to these people and attempt to recruit them into their numbers but other than that a lot of official fashwave fashion aesthetics could tie into nazi chic territory but rather than it being done as a statement to offend and shock it s a genuine attempt at promoting their values fashwave music at first hearing may not sound any different compared to normal synthwave music however one will be able to pick out subtle differences between the two which can range from simple marching sounds to speeches by well known fascists white nationalists supremacists and other far right individuals another key difference between the two is there isn t really any sense of experimentation in fashwave music leading to a lot of accusations of it sounding low effort and lazily produced almost like the music is an afterthought its rival laborwave however has had similar criticisms against its music as well so it isn t exclusively a fashwave critique fashwave has been compared to the oi movement of the early which was a far right neo nazi derivative of punk music even though oi did not initially start off as that but it was rather co opted by the nazis similar to how fashwave was an attempt to co opt synthwave and to viking metal in the both of which fell out of style very quickly it came about after richard spencer had attempted to label s group depeche mode as the soundtrack of victory for the alt right to which the members of depeche mode vehemently shot him down and not appropriate their music for his hateful cause depeche mode s politics for the record do seem to skew more towards the left to which he moved on to trying to co opt synthwave music which was gaining traction at the time but after several prominent members of the synthwave community publicly disavowed the alt right attempting to co opt their music most famous among them being robert parker in a write up done by the guardian they opted instead to create fashwave with musical acts such as xurious being probably the most well known of them other musical artists in the genre have names like cybernazi and which is just backwards where they largely keep in their little sphere of influence although some will attempt to integrate into the synthwave and vaporwave communities but once their white nationalist beliefs come to light they often get cut off completely from the more mainstream communities once this information a smaller sub sect of fashwave called trumpwave as the name implies focuses on donald j trump the president of the united states it has the same aesthetics as fashwave but with a focus trump which does tend to mesh in better with the s inspired aesthetics than the fascist imagery often used since trump s rise to fame was in the s and in many ways one could say he was the definitive symbol of s excess this will often coincide with references to his campaign slogan maga make america great again as well as the red hat that has come to symbolize the maga mantra
