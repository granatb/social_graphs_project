this page will talk a lot of heavy drug usage and as a result some particularly dark topics will come up if you yourself have found that you ve gone down this path and feel bad memories boiling up we urge you to go to a safer page on here and we hope you are getting the help you need viewer discretion is advised drugcore is an aesthetic centered completely around drug usage and what some people will do to chase that specific high this particular aesthetic can face some backlash due to its seeming glorification of abusing dangerous substances and getting high by any means necessary drugcore visuals will generally include a romanticization of getting high using popular meme fodder and tying it in to drug usage of some kind like for instance a meme that reads keep calm and love heroin or don t cry cuz it s over smile cuz it happened attached to an image of somebody shooting up heroin or images of administering drugs in unorthodox ways for example somebody sticking a tab of lsd in their eyeball there can be some artistic merit in some drugcore images that borrow heavily from other aesthetics as a means of promoting the usage of these substances grunge is a particularly popular aesthetic paired with drugcore especially given how kurt cobain went out sometimes these drugcore visuals can crossover into the territory of traumacore when drugs are used as a coping mechanism for past trauma which can add another level of darkness to the already dark world of drugcore because they more often than not acknowledge that their drug usage is self destructive and some deep down realize they need help but others unfortunately hope that the drugs ultimately claim their lives to end this misery of theirs but even then some of these drugcore images mentions things like turning up homeless as a result of their addictions stealing from people selling their bodies or doing whatever they have to do to score either money to support their habit or to score the actual drugs themselves it should also be brought up that it isn t just the usual suspects that one see in the drugcore aesthetic alcohol otc medicine nutmeg and even cigarettes can also get brought up alongside the usual suspects be it as the focus of the aesthetic or as a side dish to other substances in sometimes educational ways for the purposes of harm reduction but usually it s done in a manner that glorifies substance abuse while drugcore was and still is somewhat a big aesthetic on tumblr it s started to work its way over into the world of tiktok as well where users will post videos of themselves getting messed up on drugs or on how to make certain drugs like dmt and posting it with the hopes of going viral a lot of drugcore fashion will make reference to the user s drug addictions with a popular look called heroin chic which was popularized in mid fashion and characterized by pale skin dark circles underneath the eyes a very skinny body dark red lipstick and an angular bone structure the look characterized by emaciated features and androgyny was a reaction against the healthy and vibrant look of models at the time drugcore fashion can crossover into aesthetics that have a rather large drug user base such as raver vaporwave punk grunge kinderwhore and e people drugcore playlist by cass scullylana del reythe weeknddie antwoord
