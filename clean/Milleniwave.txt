warning milleniwave visuals do have the potential to trigger seizures due to flashing bright and or obnoxious colors and lights viewer discretion is advised milleniwave is an aesthetic born from an overall sense of millennial frustration and existential dread with the direction society is going by trying to put a happy face and a bright colorful facade over it that does a piss poor job of actually hiding it while most modern aesthetics stem from a desire to completely retreat from the seeming downward spiral society is currently on milleniwave completely embraces that things suck right now but they don t have to remain sucking and that we can all rebound from the current societal gunk and ride crescent fresh into new era inspired by the futures that never were this aesthetic is a better way to facilitate change by present an alternative milleniwave is the personal aesthetic of theinternettombraider also known as sean strife for the aesthetics wiki in order to demonstrate how to express the influences philosophy connotations and visual qualities of an aesthetic in an in depth manner the original purpose was not expressed and the status of created aesthetics is still uncertain in the wiki however this page remains up just in case somebody does decide to look at the formatting to see how to make a good page for the wiki or how to develop one s own unique aesthetic in a way where it can stand on its own here is how the creator of the page arrived at his personal aesthetic after years of attempting to find an aesthetic home eventually he decided to just make his own aesthetic of one after floating between mallgoth to raver to a brief spell in the metrosexual aesthetic to synthwave to vaporwave traveling back and forth between the two in recent years eventually he decided to draw upon his past to a happier time to develop milleniwave something he thought would ve been the name for what would later become the aesthetic a combination of his primary aesthetics as well as other outside elements such as a nihilistic worldview a crippling sense of existential dread a love of all things nostalgic specifically from the time period ranging from the all the way to the early and a love of bright fluorescent arguably obnoxious color palette that sometimes doesn t necessarily blend well with the other previously established aesthetics in many ways the visual aspect of milleniwave is a blend of lo fi vaporwave synthwave glowwave and other bright colorful and surreal aesthetics but it also blends dark and depressing elements to juxtapose the bright and colorful visuals as if to put a colorful coat of paint on a world threatened by civil unrest strife catastrophe and the destruction of the human race as a whole a milleniwave photo edit can take media that was popular from the late early century turn the contrast up all the way to so that the colors are as bright and vivid as possible with the darkness turned down so that the colors can be the star of the show with some shocking text appropriate of the time period of course but is by no means meant to be a shield for cowardly bigots to hide behind with it s a joke claims bonus points if a grainy vhs filter can be applied over it to look like a degraded vhs recording of some old show that looks like it could be close to the point of no return in terms of being able to restore it much like society milleniwave aesthetics may also play heavily on new age aesthetics but with no actual meaning or purpose to them just appreciating the visually pleasing aesthetics associated with it while acknowledging that they have no intrinsic or meaningful purpose or value in your life their usage of bright colors can also lead to some incredibly psychedelic milleniwave visuals milleniwave fashion draws inspiration from the s s and s whether it be from the fashion trends at the time or the media often portrayed around that time for example if somebody wanted to dress up like a synthwave d out batman that is completely permissible within milleniwave the key to milleniwave fashion is to stand out while hiding your true identity and to be comfortable in the process as well common fashion outside of the cosplay example cited above can include things such as face masks bandanas made especially popular during the covid pandemic beanies toboggans sunglasses especially in bright and vivid colors phat pants for the uninitiated phat pants is the actual term used for the pants with ridiculously big leg openings that were popular in the late and early think jncos and you ll get

superhero themed zentais if you are wondering why there isn t a lot of clothing that could be considered female coded in milleniwave well that s because it really hasn t been defined through a female lens a rarity among most modern aesthetics but if anybody wants to attempt to try it out they are more than welcome to or if they just wanna wear what the males wear that s cool too adidasakade
