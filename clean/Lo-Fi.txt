desaturated and toned down resulting in a dated or faded appearance the use of pastels is also commonly incorporated into lo fi visuals often giving the visuals a dreamy nostalgic appearance as with lo fi music the intentional degradation of image quality is also commonplace techniques such as the addition of visual noise decreased contrast and even chromatic aberration may be used for this purpose while easily confused with vaporwave there are several key differences between the two notably vaporwave s more prevalent usage of computer generated and surreal settings in combination with highly saturated colors lately a lot of indie aesthetics seem to take a lot of notes from the lo fi aesthetic so it can be easy to confuse the two but the most important distinction is indie tends to have more of a rock flavor to its aesthetics while lo fi might go in a slightly pop direction there are many primary genres of lo fi music but all share the feature of heavy usage of intentional sound quality degradation to achieve a more analog feel high frequencies are also commonly avoided or minimized through things such as eq and low pass filters resulting in a muted low intensity aura some of
