emancicore is a post colonial aesthetic that joyfully celebrates freedom a freedom of movement in non restrictive clothing a freedom of conscience in knowing one s clothes have been environmentally sourced and ethically produced a freedom of people in former colonies to participate in global supply chains in ways that foster their self determination avoiding exploitation as much as is currently possible a freedom of artisans and customers to liberally borrow from other cultures in their fashion designs and wardrobe choices respectively without making deferential apology for cultural appropriation a freedom of clothiers in countries with high labor costs to make products locally if they want to because a market of people willing to pay for a few good items has been cultivated intentionally a freedom to work because most of one s wardrobe has been sufficiently well made that it stands up to the rigors of daily labor while simultaneously affording entrance when necessary into white collar society and even a freedom from being overwhelmed in choosing what to wear each day as one selects from a few interoperable pieces of clothing even what one wore the day before instead of contributing to unsustainable fast fashion the emancicore aesthetic is intentionally anti consumerist and post colonial most items in an emanicicore wardrobe should eschew fast fashion they should be fairly sourced made to last and ideally possible to repair here are some notable shops for emancicore wear shibori london uk shop that works with indian artisans to make emanicore in support

its regional style honoring regional insights of what works well in a given place should be will insulated to reduce ongoing heating and cooling costs should be well built to reduce ongoing

a courtyard integrated greenhouse long back porch clerestory windows a butterfly roof for a deck these are standards even if the emancicore home incorporates tremendous embodied energy e g using insulated concrete forms embracing emancicore entails a pre theoretic aesthetic practice by which people living in core nations of the world system incorporate into their own aesthetic vis their own sense of artistic harmony handicrafts that originate from or are handmade locally using techniques that originate from peripheral nations of the world system people living in peripheral nations of the world system fuse cultural elements from other peripheral nations into their own artistic productions a pre theoretic orientation that unites artisans across cultures in unapologetic cross pollination rejecting condemnations of cultural appropriation as evidence of bourgeois alienation from co production here artisans are understood as people who produce goods or services that bear a personal stamp because the producers have sufficient voice in decisions about what they will produce and how and when they will produce it that they are not alienated from their labor a pre theoretic embrace of the elements of geographically foreign artistry often via local friends of different cultures while both explicitly not attempting to mirror adopt wholesale or attempt to fit in as a member of that culture and also while explicitly rejecting any attempts to mass produce whatever fusion may result inviting the periphery into the middle as a member of a subsidiary power not as an elite with access
