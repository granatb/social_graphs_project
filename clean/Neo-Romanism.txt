neo romanism is an aesthetic influenced by bronzepunk sandalpunk neoclassicism futurism and renaissance among others it is also the judicial system that governs many century democracies neo romanism began to boom with the popularization of neo pagan religions such as hellenism and the roman way at the end of the century which have influenced its romantic vision of those times neo romanism has had many antecedents before it became what it was since the fall of the roman empire in many rulers have tried to rebuild or even consider themselves heirs of the roman empire the most notorious example was fascist italy during world war ii which unsuccessfully tried to rebuild a kind of second roman empire on an artistic level movements such as the renaissance and neoclassicism its great difference with these two aesthetics consists mainly in how they present technology looks architecture and culture since neo romanism is much more attached to the present or science fiction with influences from greek and roman culture than a retro futuristic vision of how those societies would have advanced neo romanism has not only extended to art or judicial systems it has also acquired political overtones with projects such as the nova roma organization an international organization of admirers of the culture of ancient rome claiming to be a nation of modern romans with the administrative structure modeled on the institutions of the roman republic nova roma explicitly states that they are not a micronation but a civitas or res publica their organization however fits all the requirements to be classified as such another neo roman micronation project that stands out especially in the spanish speaking world is the so called republic of tiberia the neo romans call for a return to the classical values of ancient rome and greece but without disregarding certain modern benefits they simply consider that the excessive invidualism or collectivism of modern european societies of the and century has been more harmful than beneficial and is what has led these societies into a state of decadence and to avoid a new dark age and for humanity to prosper they must return to those values that once made them great in this case that of one of the most influential cultures ancient rome among the activities of neo romanism the following stand out admire important figures of the ancient ages and
