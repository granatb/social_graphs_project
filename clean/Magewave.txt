magewave is an aesthetic associated with the classic ideal of the wizard it shouldn t be confused with wizardcore or witchcore as it rejects the muted imagery and cottagecore stylings associated with those aesthetics magewave imagery is bright and fantastical the cabalistic gibbering of a withered greybeard palms erupting with primordial elemental force oh a warlock pointed hat raised high to the heavens siphoning the raw energy of the ley line for a ritual magewave is primarily rooted in fantasy art from the latter half of the twentieth century it is often cluttered brightly colored and highly kinetic and may take inspiration from psychedelic art often magewave includes elemental magic such as the conjuration of fire or lightning astronomical imagery such as stars planets and nebulae may be associated with magewave elements of classic tabletop fantasy and dungeon crawling may also be present though pointy hats bushy eyebrows and flowing white beards are not strictly necessary they are a hallmark of the aesthetic other examples of magewave visuals include implements of magical power staves orbs wands etc flowing robesmythical beasts such as unicornsfamiliars such as cats or owlscastles and wizard towersdungeonsrunescrystalsmagical scrolls and tomesmagic circles and other arcane diagramsmagewave music tends to be up tempo conveying a certain sense of power much like the frenetic diabolic magical eruptions of a gnarled swamp crone power and symphonic metal are often well suited to the magewave aesthetic however the life of a wizard is not all fireballs and disintegration rays the ponderous drone of dungeon synth is also an excellent reflection of the more mundane aspects of magewave
