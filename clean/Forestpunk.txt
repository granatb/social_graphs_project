forestpunk is an aesthetic that is in the naturecore family it is similar to cottagecore in its high regard for nature and mutual support however forestpunk is less restrictive of technology particularly solar powered items forestpunk also diverges from other related aesthetics in its inspiration timeframe where cottagecore is derived from a romanticization of a european rural lifestyle forestpunk like styles have and still are present in several cultures around the world examples include the nordic uralic roma celtic siberian austronesian subsaharan aborigine and native american peoples as long as there s a forest element to it you ve spotted a good inspiration be it clothing or farming while the examples mentioned earlier are good guides take a look at the image on the right for more modern inspiration for example a cabin in the middle of the woods surrounded by vines trees living off rainwater produce feeding toads deer while collecting their bones for decoration or an apartment with solar panels with plants dotting the walls rocks buttermoths moving around buying locally dressed in greens light browns goals are not only flexible but each person makes their own based on acting feral and surviving in the wild there is some overlap with cryptidcore due to the more feral nature of the aesthetic mosscore for obvious reasons and goblincore due to the recollection of mosses rocks and plants used for decoration in non harmful ways to the environment being a widespread practice like with cottagecore there is a certain set of lifestyle aspects that go hand in hand

two of the original reasons for the creation of the term forestpunk dark greens browns and some light blues are quintessential to the clothing style associated with this aesthetic with baggier clothing items being a suggestion but not a must some items to base a wardrobe are beanieslight blouseslong sleeved shirtssweatersslim to skinny jeansstraight leg jeanslight jacketsboots non rubber

importance of being in harmony with nature faux furs are the preferred option light pendants are optional and can be substituted with round solid color earrings usually black while a forestpunk living space itself is ideally a treehouse this is not necessary and an earthy vibe can be achieved with the correct placement and styling of furniture and other trinkets colours to include are those from the clothing style though white is more present to give harmony to the walls and ceilings things to consider when decorating a room are balance empty spaces with decorative spaces the woods are ordered on their own chaotic way dotted with clearings twisty groves plants mosses and rocks are for obvious reasons essentialboneslighting is important but bear in mind the mid shadow that reaches the forest floor and use that image to use curtains and lightbulbs appropriatelya small to mid sized gardening area is good but keep in mind preserving native vegetationremember plants mosses and rocksa wildlife feeder will let you see and interact with well wildlife did i already mention plants mosses and rocks anyway yeah plants mosses and rocksacoustic instruments are common but not necessary guitars relatives are common coupled with nebulous lyrics though lyrics themselves are not necessary as with literature woods similar themes are common analogies are often used again with references to bones or nature overall as long as it gives a certain boscage vibe it can be described as forestpunk some examples of such songs are broken crown mumford sonsthe moon will sing the crane

part of the forestbecause of its greater focus on ecology sustainability forestpunk is invariably linked with green politics and environmental movements as well as various equality movements forestpunk like most other aesthetics based on nature mutual aid is related to anti capitalist and anarchist movements particularly green anarchy and indigenous movements equality is fundamental to forestpunk and discrimination is heavily opposed in the community with a clear distancing from supremacist traditional value groups
