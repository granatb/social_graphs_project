northerness is an aesthetic related to nordic scandinavian areas of the world those who follow this aesthetic have the goal of living in the north in a remote location going back to the ancient pagan roots of europe and a conservation of the wilderness and the old ways some members of white nationalist movements have attempted to co opt these symbols to promote their own hateful ideology but the northerness aesthetic has absolutely no interest in promoting a white nationalist ideology and would instead like to reclaim those symbols as sacred to the nordic people as opposed to something used to promote hate especially considering for their time the viking people were actually an incredibly progressive society the northerness aesthetic is usually associated with the nordic scandinavian countries deep woodlands northern lights small red houses and ancient pagan rites it can also include the hygge atmosphere its clothing and interior styles are calm and muted things like jumpers woolen socks warm white light and birch wood are all core parts of the aesthetic along with a connection to nature and friluftsliv unlike some aspects of modern nordic fashion northerness fashion doesn t have to be modern and super minimalist it can look dated warm cozy and comfortable clothes are important in northerness due to the scandinavian countries being so far north clothes that are practical when in the outdoors are also important common clothes include thick coatsfur bootscowls and cloaksflowing white dressescapesflower crownsface paint inspired by the ancient nordic tribessilver jewelrywarm jumpers preferably lusekofte thick wool sockscomfortable jeansoutdoors boots preferably timberlands turtle necksgrandad shirtscoatsscarfsgloveshatsmedia includes books about hygge as well as anything that is fun cutesy or nordic the little book of hygge by meik wikinghygge the danish art of happiness by marie tourell søderbergthe moomins series by tove jansson there are also comics picture books tv shows and films based off of the books hjem til jul home for christmas song of the sea hilda midsommar auroraohlandsigridelliphantwardrunayggdrasill viking pagan folk songthe wolf song nordic lullaby vargsångenfaun walpurgisnachtgjallarhorn i riden såherr mannelig old swedish folk song garmarnastjernestøv auroralumine by emma krogellpagan celebrationsberry pickingrunning through the woodssaunasice bathswhittlingkulningdancing at nightfireswarm drinks such as gløgg hot chocolate and tea being together with family and friendsscented candleswalking in forestsoutdoor cookingcyclingknittingbaking especially cinnamon buns and pastries picking flowersswimmingsaunas
