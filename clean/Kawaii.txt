peculiar in that it s so diversified that it spawned many subgenres which often are far removed from the original concept for example gurokawa refers to creepy cute things and erokawa to everything erotic but cute that appeals to the sexual desire the concept of kawaii is often misunderstood in foreign countries and often wrongly applied to anything chibi in ancient japanese the words kawayushi かはゆし and kaohayushi かほはゆし were used different to the nowadays kawaii they were associated with a negative image referring to something so pitiable one can t stand it later on those words were replaced by kawaii and started to take on a positive strength instead of being seen as a weakness however before the term became used the way it is now it was mainly used by men to objectify women and during the it was very common to be catcalled kawaiko chan かわい子ちゃん which is similar to the english cutie later on the meaning of kawaii changed once again when women reclaimed the term by starting to use it to describe everything that is just like them cute in the the number of people who use the term kawaii exploded resulting in the birth of kawaii culture the japanese word kawaii which previously was
