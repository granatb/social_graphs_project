trillwave is a very important internet aesthetic revolving around both music clothing and visual art before getting into the history a brief overview of trillwave can be defined as wavy trap beats rapping with vaporwave esque digital art with a more gun drugs hype branding overall hip hop influence on subjects of the photo and music the word trill has been around since the early the word itself is a combination of the words true and real the word has the meaning of genuine and authentic often to describe art or a trait in someone the word trill also has different uses in linguistics and music visually trill art has been around since the with memphis rappers such as lord infamous gangsta boo and graveyard production however back in the this aesthetic of cover art was called horrorcore which is still very popular in present day horrorcore is the stepping stone for trillwave in terms of both visually and rap flow there has been debates on the true origin of trillwave and the father of the online movement but the wavy flow with ethereal samples signature sound started in with viper s earlier albums later on lil b birthed cloud rap which is what he called it in sometime in the early trillwave was formed from cloud rap trillwave was more of a homage to memphis rappers but combining new school mixing and production ex wavy beats with memphis flow cloud rap was more of a wide open genre with many styles and ways to produce that signature cloud sound raider klan is the most well known trill collective housing members such as spaceghostpurrp denzel curry xavier wulf chris travis mike dece ruben slikk eddy baker amongst many others raider klan is considered the founding fathers of trillwave and phonk music although lil b brought inspiration to many raider klan is by far the most inflencial in terms of rap flow beats sound design and aesthetics paying direct homage to horrorcore later on vaporwave would boom in popularity due to trillwave evolving and both trillwave and vaporwave would bounce off of each other with visual art vaporwave taking elements from trillwave and trillwave taking elements from vaporwave this is how the whole gold uzi fiji water codeine drugs aesthetic came to be this shift in visual trends in the early would be crucial for the rest of trillwave in yung lean s ginseng strip exploded the popularity of trillwave and cloud rap and changed the internet forever at this time bucket hats nike adidas fiji water and cgi scenes were the craze to go along with this yung gud suicideyear yung sherman and whitearmor also changed the way people made trillwave beats smoother triplet patterns with heavier hitting drums all layering on top of a smooth ethereal sample obtained from deep on the internet this movement is still rippled with a lot of hip hop music we hear today many people assume yung lean to be the father of cloud rap which is simply inaccurate due to the paragraphs above which explained the origin and fathers yung lean is however a pioneer and legendary figure in the underground you will not find a single person in the cloud rap trillwave community who does not know yung lean in the end trillwave was birthed from thing to thing to thing and it is hard to track down the true pinpoint origin of it the above paragraphs should be all you need to know in terms of who started what trillwave combines a lot of aesthetics such as vaporwave seapunk and junglecore a lot of blue purple pink green and neon colors fiji water codeine weed old web and dolphins are just some examples of the aesthetics which are featured in music visual videos and cover arts japanese and arabic language can also be featured on cover arts as stated in the music portion this wave of aesthetic and music has significantly died down into obscurity and is no longer talked about and if it is it is talked about and reminisced on as the golden age of soundcloud when the trillwave aesthetic was booming and seemingly all over the platform is referred to as the golden age of the internet anyways so it s fitting for people to consider the same for this aesthetic since the aesthetic revolves so heavily around internet culture as mentioned in the history segment this style of art has been around since the and is the founding father of the whole symmetrically balanced visual art such as what vaporwave use to be back in png s on one side of the cover art flipped horizontally onto the other side to create a clean look and fill in empty space for cover arts another popular wave back in was an image of various things with a white background if it was a png the white background was generated by soundcloud stuff like jewelry guns video game characters flowers etc the items depended on the artists aesthetic cover arts did play a huge part back then to help enhance a song s vibe atmosphere title s did as well trill beats and rap titles very often had the ｆａｎｃｙ ｆｏｎｔ fancy font and emojis sometimes languages such as japanese chinese arabic and various unicode fonts characters eventually artists realized not everyone can read unicode on their machines phones and many artists stopped using it adding onto the visual element of trillwave it s one of the most if not the most open aesthetic visually anything can be trill as stated above if art is imperfect unusual genuine and interesting it s trill this can range from cyber aesthetics to holy palaces to weed and drug usage it s really all over the place hue shifted images lazy art and minor edits all can be considered trillwave trillwave is a mixture of damn near every other internet based aesthetic in existence such as vaporwave junglecore seapunk kawaii etc the list will go on and on music wise trill music is almost impossible to specifically define the best way to describe trill music is music that you can smoke to listen to in the background or listen to with friends some decent examples of trill music is chris travis miss me when i m gone and chris travis wavy world trill music can be identified by the rawness of a song how raw and heavy hitting the mixing is whether it be vocals or instruments plays a big factor modern rap both underground and mainstream tend to be more polished and perfected with mixing and beat patterns whereas trill music has less of that perfection other subgenres of trillwave is r b trap and vaportrap featuring hihat patterns rough mixing with and snares and offkey instruments sample choice include samples from video games on the nes snes and others other samples can be jazz trance music j pop amongst many others listing out every trillwave vaportrap producer would take about a decade so i will leave this list here this list was made by paulon records amongst many others which are credited at the bottom this chart features hundreds of producers from the who left a huge impact on the underground and shaped a lot of aesthetics still present today trill rap usually consists of slowed monotone vocals and rappers will usually rap about women money drugs guns video games and anime taking heavy influence from chicago drill rap and combing the sound with memphis flow sometimes in some older trill songs you could also hear struggle talk rapping about racism sexism issues in america and the world the cruel reality of the music industry etc since this rap is underground and many artists were unsigned they didn t need to worry about mass critics or their label rejecting their song due to speaking out on the industry here is a perfect example of trill rap an imperfect yet wavy catchy beat matched with new school lyric topics with the old school flow chopped screwed slowed reverb etc are birthed from dj screw his technique of slowing down songs chopping them so words repeat and sound smooth among various other things made their way into trillwave this further makes trill songs easier to relax to and chopped screwed songs often have a heavier aesthetic of drugs weed with them slowed reverb songs gained popularity much later than chopped screwed songs but originated from trillwave as well rejjie hype underwater ft misogi in a subgenre of trillwave was birthed dubbed holytrap holytrap took trillwave and ascended it s atmosphere to a whole new galaxy sample selection was church choirs vaporwave samples ambient dreamscapes all of that visually the cover arts were more focused on angels ambient architecture water mountains terrain and clouds this ep called ａｒｃｈｉｔｅｃｔｕｒｅ architecture by cight is a historic and widely loved ep on soundcloud featuring at the time the top dogs of trillwave holytrap night lovell aka klnv benjamin greg falco and boys the sounds and production on this ep are still copied and continually inspire new producers every day lilac certainty not long after holytrap was birthed wave made it s way into the scene wave is the ultimate test of a producers skills combining the imperfect and wavy touch of trillwave the sample selection atmosphere of holytrap and now adding insane patterns for hihats snares sound effects and percs on top of all of this there was way more reverb on all of these instruments meaning every aspect of a beat was more ambient louder and more emotional this ep titled ｈｅａｌ heal by lilac is a perfect example of wave trap dj smokey talk dat shit phonk has been around for quite awhile taking heavy inspiration from horrorcore of the phonk music samples horrorcore often layering old vocals on top of jazz video game ambient or ost samples the layering of vocals leaves behind artifacts such as kicks snares hihats and percs that were not eq d out leaving an extra layer of trill or imperfections in songs phonk music also features lo fi aspects such as lower sample quality phonky snares hihats and percs the bass and or kicks in songs are often distorted in some ways and the mixing is usually more bass heavy dj smokey has been making phonk for well over half a decade and has been a staple in the community many new phonk artists are still taking inspiration from dj smokey and adding onto what he left for new generation producers to pick up on dj smokey s positive squad the soundtrack vol is a great way to learn and get introduced to the phonk underground shortly after trillwave made its way into relevancy in the early otaku rappers started rapping about the nerd life anime hentai video games movies japan etc it wasn t until shortly after that it had so much traction that it was its own genre dubbed nerdcore for starters the beats were way more retro sounding sampling etc osts same patterns as trillwave music but a different vibe lyrics were again focused on otaku culture some of the earliest pioneers of nerdcore were undeniably melo flamez and gf retro together with some other rappers producers forming otaku mob back in including josip on deck who made the legendary song called anime pu y popularized and praised by youtuber etika years later after otaku mob many other collectives sprung up including goldsamuraiempire later formed into retrosamuraiempire retro mob and bcbc by nerdcore was a staple on soundcloud rapper sensei ion carried nerdcore into the whole wavy scene blending trillwave and nerdcore perfectly to create outer dimensional songs often accompanied by tivo saki dripfest ᵐ ˣ ｇｏｏｎ ｐａｌａｃｅ ｍｉｘ plld af mix im not ok pls leave me alone ｅｙｅｂｒｏｗ ｂｏｙｓ ｍｉｘ
