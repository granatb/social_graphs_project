this page needs work sloanie sloane or sloane ranger is a stereotypical young upper middle or upper class british person who pursues a distinctive fashionable lifestyle sometimes these people are referred to as posh but it is important to note that not all posh people are sloanes probably the most famous example of this subculture was diana spencer before and around the time she married prince charles another notable example is the tv character tim nice but dim an old ardinian the term is a humorous combination of sloane square a location in chelsea london famed for the wealth of residents and frequenters and the television character the lone ranger the sloane ranger has roots in the english upper classes families were peers of the realm members of the royal family or those with titles presented by the royal family or landed gentry people who controlled estates and received income from tenants renting land on the estate men in these families were members of the house of lords who had huge influence on british government and society during the british colonial era british aristocrats settled in australia canada india and the united states in the united states they formed the wasp and preppy subcultures which can be very similar to the sloane ranger aesthetic in the many of the old estates fell into disrepair due to rising costs and the decline of the servant class today many old estates are museums and historical sites other estates which remain in the family are rented out for movie and television productions such as highclare castle the setting for downton abbey despite the poverty of the aristocracy relative to their ancestors an old family name or title gives a sloane status part of the sloane ranger aesthetic is a sense of nostalgia for the past whether it be the century or the the nostalgia tends to be very patriotic romanticizing british history and historical figures such as winston churchill and members of the royal family and ignoring the dark side of british imperialism most of the things that sloanes value are very old they do not like or trust things which are new foreign or french english patriotism including extreme loyalty to the queen and
