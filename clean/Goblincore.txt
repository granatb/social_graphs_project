goblincore is an aesthetic based on the appreciation of aspects of nature not typically regarded as beautiful these aspects can range from animals such as frogs and snails to materials such as moss mud plants and fungi such as mushrooms as a part of this beloved ugliness is the goblin itself a malevolent thieving creature in european folklore but in goblincore a carefree representation of one s infatuation with nature s ugliness and general unpredictability goblincore is popular in the lgbtq community especially among non binary transgender demigender people a part of goblincore is the

but most goblincore fans seem to like outfits with several clashing patterns colors lots of the clothing is worn out thrifted or second hand for a more comfortable feel most goblincore fans enjoy getting dirt so keeping their clothes fresh and clean isn t a top priority cozy oversized sweaters worn out or customized jeans and overalls and unique socks are staples in goblincore fashion these people like to wander around the woods and collect random objects that pique their interest since they love nature so much earthy colored clothes like brown or green fit them the bestgoblins are often seen in dark green or brown clothes sometimes they will also have belts with alchemists pouches or a satchel to store shiny objects goblincore has been accused of and criticized for being antisemitic this is because goblins especially when depicted as ugly thieving or greedy creatures obsessed with shiny things have sometimes been used as an antisemitic caricature people have suggested alternatives to the name calling it gremlincore instead of goblincore or simply changing it to crowcore dragoncore or other aesthetics similar to goblincore there are jewish people who disapprove of goblincore but also those who do not one explanation of why goblincore is not essentially antisemitic goblin as a term and as a creature is a very old concept they re one of the many types of fae with all that that implies love of shiny things not afraid of a bit of muck recognizing the pretty in the conventionally ugly and generally considered to be outsiders antisemitic regimes much later on in history used a conveniently mutated interpretation of goblins as an allegory for jews as just one of many ways to dehumanize them to make it easier for the general populace to stand by and watch them being persecuted it s at this time where goblins stay to be described as demonically ugly greedy creatures with big pointy noses poor hygiene and a tendency to eat children the way goblins are portrayed in media now with prime examples being tolkein and rowling is antisemitic and should be called out the way goblins are portrayed by goblincore is much closer to the original fae being and not antisemitic in the slightest however as another user on the same thread pointed out unconscious stereotyping and bigotry is very much a part of human nature and not everyone may be able to distinguish between ancient folkloric traditions and more recent anti jewish propaganda some tropes that carry heavy antisemitic baggage are goblins as greedy and power hungry ugly goblins especially featuring warty hooked noses and or green skin and goblins as both depraved and contagious one jewish blogger s advice for avoiding antisemitism in goblincore so what does all of this mean well first and foremost it means that you have to be careful how you depict your goblins how when drawing your goblinsonas or goblin ocs stay away from drawing them with huge hooked and warted noses don t make their skin green or red personally i prefer grey skin for goblins if your goblin has sharp teeth don t make them huge and obvious because modern goblins are fair folk it s difficult to depict them without pointed ears but try not to exaggerate the proportions behavior stop with the greedy little goblin thing that directly comes from jewish stereotypes your goblins are allowed to collect shiny things they find but don t make them greedy about it have your goblin share what they collect make it a community effort sharing the things you love is way better than being miserly anyhow and sharing more represents what we as goblins should want in our community also be careful with your goblins being terrors yes there are usually evil beings in every single race whether mythological or real but just be really really careful hitler loved to depict jews eating the good germans or terrorizing communities so even if your goblin is an evil one be really really careful and be sure to educate yourself first so you re not just perpetuating the same tired shit that hitler did collecting coins you just can t depict yourself or your goblin character collecting only coins and being very greedy with them that s literally doing nothing but echoing the same propaganda that hitler used against us collect them all you want but if i see greedy little goblin hoarding coins all for themselves i swear i m gonna hit the fan to clarify you can absolutely show off you coin collection in the goblin tags just be careful how you frame it goblincore has also been accused of excessively cross tagging in the witchblr community something taken very seriously on the website tumblr external links to help get a better understanding of this aesthetic r goblincorenote if you happen to know any stores
