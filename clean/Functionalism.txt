functionalism in the realm of aesthetics is that the idea that an object should be determined solely by its function rather than by aesthetic considerations and that anything practically designed will be inherently beautiful it also appears in architecture as a principle that buildings should be designed with practical considerations in mind where factors such as use material and structure are the primary determinations of how a building will look though functionalism is linked very closely to modern architecture it has been prevalent in earlier eras of history as well
