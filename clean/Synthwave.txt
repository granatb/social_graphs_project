synthwave also known as outrun is a particular aesthetic that draws a lot of inspiration from the while it does often get lumped in with vaporwave there are significant differences between the two genres while it is particularly regarded as a musical genre there are examples of synthwave in movies tv shows art and video games the genre is credited as being started by acts such as college kavinsky and justice although a fair argument could be made that the first big mainstream album evoking the synthwave vibe and aesthetic could be traced back to the sophomore daft punk album discovery the music strongly shares some key traits within the french house italo disco musical genres the true proto synthwave acts came from musical scores of films in the created by the likes of john carpenter halloween the thing they live etc vangelis blade runner and tangerine dream firestarter while the genre has started to dip in popularity slightly there is still a very devoted following and a lot of musicians still sell decently the french house sound first began to develop with the french house genre popularized by groups like daft punk a style of house music originally produced by french artists that was a popular strand of the late and european dance music scene and a form of euro disco the genre has also been referred to as french touch filter house and tekfunk over the years the defining characteristics of the sound are heavy reliance on filter and phaser effects both on and alongside samples from late and early american or european disco tracks or original hooks strongly inspired by such samples causing thicker harmonic foundations than the genre s descendants popular artists in the french house genre include benjamin diamondcassiusdaft punkdavid guettajusticekavinskymodjomr oizosebastianstardustthomas bangaltervitalic commando ninja official movie commando ninja an example of synthwave cinema synthwave visuals draw a lot of inspiration from graphics often seen during the such as sunset graphics neon grids neon lights sports cars wireframe vector graphics pixel art that is designed to look like an old school bit video game video cassettes arcades malls etc some people will often confused synthwave visuals with visuals from the vaporwave genre which has led to derivative aesthetics of the two fashwave and laborwave mashing the two together to promote their respective agendas but there are key differences in not only what is used in the art of the respective aesthetics but also the tone of it while vaporwave can tend to have a more tongue in cheek and sarcastic tone to it synthwave is incredibly earnest with its love of everything and is made in tribute to the era rather than critiquing it despite this however it s not uncommon for artists from the two scenes to collaborate to make art or music one noteworthy example includes synthwave artist bart graft collaborating with vaporwave future funk artist bubble keiki to produce the album emerald synthwave visuals may also borrow very heavily from cyberpunk most notably the film blade runner and the anime akira but celebrate the aesthetics of it rather than heeding the initial warnings that were offered by these works about the risks of technology advancing too fast the synthwave color palette differs from vaporwave because while vaporwave tends to utilize a lot of washed out colors to show the wear and tear of time on the past synthwave uses colors as bold vibrant and colorful as the themselves which can lead to some nice looking crossovers with the glowwave aesthetic the least talked about in the synthwave community is the fashion aspect the fashion tends to be heavily inspired by the fashion seen in movies and tv shows especially shows like miami vice but more casual themed clothes can be worn in the synthwave aesthetic volga verdiakade wearzubaz for the true look moonlambo you are my obsession official music video synthwave music sounds like the
