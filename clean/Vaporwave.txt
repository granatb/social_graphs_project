vaporwave is a music genre branching from electronic chillwave but the unique and iconic visual aesthetic cultivated alongside it is now debatably more popular and recognizable than the music itself vaporwave as an aesthetic and movement has been described as a tongue in cheek commentary on modern consumerism and the soulless glamour of late capitalism its purposeful vagueness has led to more overt and blatant offshoots of vaporwave like fashwave which attempts to co opt a lot of vaporwave symbolism to promote a fascist ideology or laborwave which removes the ambiguity of vaporwave s capitalist critiques in favor of promoting a marxist ideology though both of them also tend to blend in a lot of synthwave aesthetics as well leading to many people assuming the two aesthetics are the same vaporwave like many other aesthetics gives you nostalgia even if you weren t around from the to early both the images and music mostly the music send you to an era that once was one of the big early inspirations for the vaporwave visual aesthetic draws direct inspiration from the memphis group a name given to a group of post modern designers and architects founded in milan italy by ettore sottsass in the early the original group disbanded in but their influence still lives on to this day during the group s heyday in the and early it was seen as a tacky product in its era and its popularity faded by the mid late toward the turn of the millennium it began to gain appreciation from designers collectors and many of those with nostalgia and fond memories of the decade the bright colors and simple shapes would later inspire media and products aimed at children and youth of the era including nickelodeon mtv pee wee s playhouse discovery zone gymboree trapper keepers toys and many other staples of kidcore which given the time period it was popular in makes it perfect to fit in with the vaporwave aesthetic since most members of the vaporwave community were kids during the time the memphis style was popular the genre emerged in from online communities such as turntable fm in subsequent years it gained popularity through websites such as bandcamp soundcloud last fm and agora road s macintosh cafe its rise in popularity coincided with the decline of seapunk and while the two certainly share similar aesthetic choices there is a distinct difference between the two the key difference between seapunk and vaporwave is that seapunk had a much more focused aesthetic on early cg images and aquatic life on the other hand vaporwave cast a broader net on its aesthetic cues choosing to highlight the period from the to early crossing over somewhat with the aesthetics of it is debated when the period that vaporwave is centered around ended some mark the september terrorist attacks as the ending point while others mark the great recession and rise of social media in the late as the end point there is an air of ambiguity of whether vaporwave artists are either celebrating the rampant capitalism that birthed the vaporwave aesthetics ironically mocking the hollowness of a lot of these visual cues which mistakes shallowness for depth or just happens to think they look or sound cool nostalgic it is generally left up to the listener as to what they think the artist meant with the final work dead mall series the vulnerable marley station mall ft music by s u r f i n g from deep fantasy there are several niche communities that fans from the vaporwave community gather and discuss and share vaporwave music these are the r vaporwave subreddit and agora road s macintosh cafe member forum popular visuals utilized in vaporwave aesthetics can include but are not limited to anime and cartoons often from the to but not always ie sailor moon neon genesis evangelion and even the simpsons as popularized by artist lucian hughes drug use almost always in the form of codeine syrup or lean or pills classical sculptures such as the apollo belvedere and laocoon consumerism often displays brand names and logos such as adidas pepsi cola microsoft windows macintosh plus playstation arizona iced tea and fiji water computer hardware and graphics from the early the windows operating system is used often in vaporwave artwork and edits as are images of early computers such as the first of apple s macintosh pcs city skylines malls sadness or distress often employed to emphasize the ironic soullessness of the vaporwave aesthetic in a sad but aesthetically pleasing kind of way liminal spaces while on a creepier level the surreal and nostalgic feeling goes quite well with this aesthetic grids lines shapes the inclusion of this in particular has led to some confusion with synthwave aesthetics pink and teal altered reality pictures with unnatural hues and tones can be seen throughout this aesthetic heavily edited pictures of the world around you can soon become unrecognizable and foreign glitches and the gratuitous use of japanese korean and chinese characters japanese seems to be one of the most used languages in the vaporwave community s artwork 現代のコンピュー music video vaporwave was first characterized by its heavy use of samples from the and music typically lounge smooth jazz or muzak samples are often pitched down layered or altered in classic chopped and screwed style however vaporwave has started to incorporate more original compositions with a heavy focus on ambiance as seen by acts like artists have also started to get creative with the physical mediums they sell their albums on ranging from the conventional vinyl and cassette to the unusual minidiscs and floppy disks there are so many vaporwave music artists out there that we won t be able to exactly list them off but we can give you a list of some vaporwave artists that can serve as an introduction to the genre some of these artists include macintosh plusvektroid creator of floral shoppe skylar spence the artist formerly known as saint pepsi george clantons u r f i n e l e p a t h テレパシー能力者infinity シ corp angela regina rossiblank bansheeluxury elitetupperwaveyuni wastux iocosmic cyclerマクロスmacross shopdesiredbarbwaltersサクラsakura internationalvaporwave has garnered some significant attention from the music press as of late most recently artists such as vektroid hke infinity frequencies the proyect and have gotten covered by music sites and blogs such as the guardian dummy fader fact the wire thump vice red bull music academy the quietus resident advisor tinymixtapes marcel s music journal cokemachineglow the needle drop and others coincidentally several vaporwave zines have started popping up the most notable of them being private suite magazine a less often spoken about characteristic of vaporwave is vaporfashion or clothing inspired by the vaporwave aesthetic this can include brands that were popular in the and such as nike esprit fila adidas etc as well as specialized stores that sell vaporfashion most famously among these brands being broken reality vaporwave and irony vaporwave unsurprisingly also has a rather strong and thriving presence in video games although it s primarily in the independent game space the two best known examples of vaporwave video games are broken reality and mall quest although one can find many examples of vaporwave gaming on gamejolt to play for free which is fitting for the general tone vaporwave goes for as for games co opted by the vaporwave scene a lot of super nintendo nintendo and playstation era games get embraced by the scene but the most popular games embraced by the community include earthbound waverace jumping flash and the original super smash brothers while not completely vaporwave the independent game secret little haven utilizes some of the aesthetics often found in the vaporwave community but it lacks a lot of the irony and sarcasm often found within vaporwave opting for something more earnest and deeply personal most vaporwave entertainment seems to be relegated to youtube series although that doesn t stop a lot of major corporations to ironically co opt a lot of vaporwave aesthetics for their marketing campaigns with series such as dan bell s dead mall series and retail archeology being prime examples of cataloging what vaporwave is all about while skycorp home video takes the vaporwave aesthetic and becomes a major pastiche of early entertainment and commercials the films spider man into the spider verse valerian city of a thousand planets and the wave use the vaporwave aesthetic within their respective worlds and for stylistic and creative narrative due to a lot of similar aesthetic cues and colors to the untrained eye it s easy to confuse the aesthetics of both synthwave and vaporwave and some people have tried to make politically motivated aesthetics that do indeed confuse the two aesthetics and assume they are the same let it be known they are indeed two completely separate aesthetics with two completely different goals in mind while vaporwave is a bit more tongue in cheek and can be seen in certain lights as being critical of the capitalist system and may or may not be making some sort of political statement with their co opting of corporate symbolism and is more wink wink nudge nudge with the cheesy elements of this synthwave is more of a genuinely earnest celebration of all things and now since a lot of synthwave artists are starting to expand their scope and are playing with a more centric sound and imagery which can lead to further muddying of the waters between what is synthwave and what is vaporwave in all of its cheesy over the top glory this confusion is also not helped due to the fact there have been several instances of synthwave and vaporwave artists collaborating on projects most notably synthwave artist bart graft has collaborated with future funk artist bubble keiki to make the album emerald in short the main difference between synthwave and vaporwave is vaporwave tends to be more ironic while synthwave tends to be more earnest with their embracing of and aesthetics eccojams future funk hardvapor hypnagogic pop mallsoft signalwave simpsonswave slushwave tradwave tumblewave universetic
