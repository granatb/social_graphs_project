bodycon of which its name is a shortening of the pronunciation of the english words body conscious but was not entirely based around the dress and would come to include the general female fashion of the bubble economy period the style was most popular in the mid to late and early usually around the period late to at the peak of its popularity this style was influenced by the japanese economy at this time as well as the widespread popularity of dance based nightlife in japan in the and especially venues playing italo disco city pop eurobeat hyper techno techpara and later house music there are also parallels with the mid japanese trend of the satirisation and exaggeration of american fashion and lifestyles the body conscious fashion presented by azzedine alaía at the milan collection was the first of many experimental designs to attract attention internationally by the mid especially from the autumn of onwards following the signing of the plaza accord japan had reached its economic peak in what became known as the bubble economy and japanese companies suddenly with a large amount of money to spend were known to give generous budgets to the uniforms of female employees representing at that point the fact a then unprecedented number of women had entered the workforce in some estimates of those women worked as an office lady or ol for short the ol was usually a young woman usually around who kept care of her appearance performed secretarial work and was obedient to her male colleagues they were by intention meant to represent a beautiful image in order to represent the office often called an office flower combining with the image obsessed general feeling of the period as well as the boom of the japanese city of kobe as a hub of fashionable young women in a style called the kobe kei new tora a strong desire for luxury sexy daring and flashy fashion grew amongst japanese women ironically despite an increasing social progress of feminism japan had entered an era in which women were trying to regain their sensual femininity a key selling point of the bubble queen bodikon style was its sexy appeal enhanced by the brash sexual style of flattering lines to the body and usage of neon colourful designs as well as the booming disco scene in roppongi an area of central tokyo that grew increasingly in popularity clubs like the maharaja chain and later juliana s in the early were central meeting areas for those participating the now mainstream style the maharaja chain of discothéques was hugely influential on the style it was here that the fan waving trend popular in the aesthetic started when maikos young geishas would go to the local kyoto branch of maharaja carrying feathered fans increasingly from onwards women would dance in synchronised dance routines called para para or more often at this point a hyper techno form of it later known as techpara wearing their bodikon fashion women especially in juliana s would often dance a mixture of freestyle dancing influenced by the rave scene in the west and this new para dancing on the otachidai a kind of platform in the club satircally named after the platform where the imperial family would appear reflecting how the bubble customer was expected to be treated like royalty often driving male crowds crazy the japanese media covered this extravagant partying extensively angering traditionalists in the ruling political party the ldp and combining with the lax and sexual atmosphere in the roppongi scene as opposed to other more formal nightlife areas created a misguided impression of juliana s being some kind of strip club and therefore the fashion as that of strippers ultimately leading to the demise of juliana s additionally dc abbreviation for designer and character brands began to take off from the early and their youth led shibuya based stores began to sell bodikon clothes marketed towards the young and affluent workforce that post war japan had produced these affordably priced clothes began to permeate throughout the country and became a cultural staple of what the bubble era the era in which the bubble economy took place in is remembered as in its legacy by the japanese there were also influences of revival apparent in the glamorous hairstyles popular amongst japanese women and usage of furs as well as the briefly popular bodikon style this was most likely caused by the re airing of popular movies such as kimi no na wa your name by nhk in and also called the new rich executive woman and more commonly nowadays the bubble queen a combination of bubble economy and disco queen a notable party subculture amongst young women in the late around clubs in tokyo and osaka style the general aesthetic faded quickly after the rapid collapse of the bubble economy in early this was due to a variety of reasons including the sudden loss of a large leisure income making luxury brands unaffordable the decline of the optimism surrounding the japanese economy the closure of many clubs in the roppongi area as well as the decline of the company in the centralisation of japanese life as partying such as this was hugely based around company hours and often paid for by the company also by late the style had become increasingly dated juliana s was getting bad previously mentioned above publicity and it had become so mainstream that it began to be viewed as tacky and trashy by the new trendsetters emerging from areas such as harajuku and shibuya where the short lived shibuya casual movement sought to remove the glamour of bodikon the style had visibly disappeared from the streets by mid but was still in some kind of existence especially in clubs until early before finally vanishing however the influence of bubble queen bodikon style can be seen in the late styles of gyaru where the party influenced culture and sexiness appeal is reflected additionally many of the pioneers of gyaru originally started out dancing in the juliana s discothéque where lots of influence came from make up included scarlet lipstick bushy or generally thick eyebrows and wavy long hair this could include straight or curled
