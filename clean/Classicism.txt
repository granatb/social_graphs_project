classicism in the arts refers generally to a high regard for a classical period classical antiquity in the western tradition as setting standards for taste which the classicists seek to emulate the art of classicism typically seeks to be formal and restrained it is a specific genre of philosophy expressing itself in literature architecture art and music which has ancient greek and roman sources and an emphasis on society in some situations classicism can be politicized by white nationalists with the intention of creating an impression of western culture from many diverse cultures this can then be portrayed as what we the white race are protecting an ahistorical medley of very different white cultures source note that while this may be difficult to distinguish from legitimate cultural study in some cases that is the purpose of such politicization it prevents everyone from immediately seeing through the veil of cryptofascism this by no means forms the majority of the classicist aesthetic however and thankfully for the modern reinterpretation of classicism based on mythology see hellenic classicism roman republic renaissance neoclassicism coloration literature odyssey by homerthe iliad by homersymposium by platocorpus aristotelicum by aristotle fashion
