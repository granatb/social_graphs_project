inspired by a romanticized interpretation of western agricultural life it is centered on ideas of simple living and harmony with nature themes associated with cottagecore include self sufficiency baking and caring for people while the aesthetic is prevalent on several social media sites such as on instagram and more recently tiktok the community notably prospers on tumblr it is particularly popular within lesbian and woman loving woman wlw communities the aesthetic is a continuation of many other nature based aesthetics but draws the most influence and is arguably a complete revival of the romanticization of the english countryside from the romantic and victorian periods its visuals are based on the domestic lifestyle associated with living in this type of environment with all images providing a sense of comfort and mild adventure despite a number of its followers taking a progressive and subversive outlook on life cottagecore has been also criticized for its romanticism of eurocentric farming life it has also been criticized in the context of north american and australian settings an inadvertent celebration of the aesthetics of colonialism as well as the ways it often simplifies and underestimates the labor of farmers it is due to these connotations that the use of cottagecore aesthetics has been adopted by the tradwives community and members of the far right as forms of propaganda this has led to media criticism despite their opposition to lgbtq and anti capitalist adherents of cottagecore cottagecore is often compared to aesthetics such as grandparentcore which seek to evoke a similar sense of nostalgia it is also related to naturecore and warmcore the hay wain by john constable shows how cottagecore visuals are a continuation of depictions of the traditional english countryside this section is under constructioncottagecore is a continuation of ideas that have existed for millenia and uses visuals that are based in the aesthetic of the european countrysides the evolution of these ideas into contemporary cottagecore an aesthetic borne out of the internet and among teenagers to young adults is the primary history of this section but also describes the history of cottagecore s precursors as well on of the largest influences is the artistic movement of romanticism which emphasized a connection to nature the past and the senses rather than logic the had a fashion and home decor aesthetic known as romantic revival and shabby chic led mostly by the companies gunne sax and laura ashley cottagecore fashion is largely a continuation of the designs that they used prairie dresses in floral calico print with heirloom sewing details the interior design details of shabby chic have similar motifs with cottagecore with the same grandmotherly connotations the japanese alternative fashion mori kei also had an extremely large influence on the aesthetic especially since the fashion was popular on tumblr in the early to mid this was the de facto feminine nature based and cozy aesthetic however like many other trends mori kei dwindled out but as cottagecore gained in popularity there was a spike in google trend searches for the fashion showing a clear lineage in the fashion in tumblr the animated show moomin valley became a meme and frequent topic of conversation on the website it popularized cottagecore as the characters lived in this sort of environment with scenes of foraging frolicking and adventuring tumblr users wished for this sort of lifestyle and the television show became a common gateway to the aesthetic of course studio ghibli animated films have also been quite prevalent on the site and users would have noted the commonalities between these two franchises and explored similar photographs and activities during this same time there was the trend of yearning on tumblr users would post about wishing for romantic partners and situations to happen focusing on tenderness such as holding hands and sharing fruit during the coronavirus pandemic cottagecore activities such as baking bread playing animal crossing gardening sewing and other handicrafts rose in popularity coupled with a rise of the app tiktok people were more exposed to crafting and these activities became trends another quarantine trend in was lirika matoshi s strawberry dress a pink tulle gown with sequined strawberries and a milkmaid style as vogue describes it the appeal of the dress is that sweet strawberry print is deeply nostalgic hearkening back to a time long before covid to a childhood innocence that feels especially soothing right now like moomin valley the dress was incredibly meme ified with it appearing in non cottagecore contexts such as in fan art its popularity led to people especially on tiktok to discover the aesthetic throughout cottagecore was made aware to various audiences as publications such as vox and the new york times reported on the trend it later filtered down to various magazines and other interest sites making the aesthetic s name fairly well known among fashion interior design and crafting enthusiasts the aesthetic became even more well known with the release of taylor swift s july album cardigan as the singer s visual and musical styles would influence many of her fans tastes cottagecore has a naturalistic color palette with light green foliage browns of natural stones and wood straw and flowers pastels are common in painting lighting is always natural with sunlight being the de facto light source morning to late afternoon golden hour is the range of lighting different motifs appear throughout cottagecore in various ways rather than limiting a photo subject to just pictures of its natural form some items appear in various mediums such as in illustration printed fabric novelty dishware and other manners of home decor the most common motifs are strawberries mushrooms and flowers nature is one the main visuals of the aesthetic one of the most common photographic subjects is wild fields of grass with small wildflowers dotted throughout a meadow for cottagecorers to frolick in deciduous forest is also common always in green during spring and summer with autumnal colors and wintertime being rare however unlike more wild aesthetics such as naturecore there are almost always signs of human involvement in the rural space fences bridges clothes lines picnicking and controlled amounts of forestation are more often than not elements of these images in cottagecore humans have to have presence in the natural environment shaping the landscape into home gardens are of course a manifestation of this interaction between nature and human intervention these gardens are always done in the english style meaning that the land is cultivated to look more wild and with great variety rather than geometric and controlled ponds are often included as well as wheelbarrows wooden benches gazebos and other garden paraphernalia often large and ornate glass greenhouses are featured which are more in line with a wealthy english nobility aesthetic as opposed to modest and attainable rural life more mundane and achievable gardens can be featured and they largely focus on the crops grown there such as frills of lettuce sprouting from the ground or strawberries in a white washed planter box a typical cottagecore cottage the other main visual and the one that gives cottagecore its namesake is the cottage which is a fairly loose term that includes multiple types of homes the most common cottagecore house is the archetypical english thatch roofed cottage with painted white or rusticated stone walls chimneys and shrubbery in the front the second most common is a miniature house or shed constructed from wood with a gabled roof novel and twee decorations and painting is common in these miniature houses and they are typically painted in pastel feature decorative carvings and windowboxes filed with plants english manors are also heavily featured in cottagecore and fit many aesthetics such as tudor cottage orne and even neoclassical among others these mansions are typically more extravagent than what cottagecore is claimed to be which will be expanded upon in the controversy section architecture that is incredibly fanciful and fairy tale esque is also common they often look to be falling apart sloping or impossibly precarious this fits into the fairy and witch influences images of the interiors of these cottages are also common and the way how cottagecore enthusiasts can express their love for the aesthetic without living in the countryside setting these interiors show the farmhouse style furniture linens and various knicknacks that would exist in the space the objects are frequently cluttered and mismatched to create a cozy and carefree atmosphere and are frequently connotative of grandparents such as quilts tea sets and vintage crockery however unlike other kitschy aesthetics these items tend to be practical and have a united aesthetic with similar motifs and a limited color palette continuing with the nature motifs plants are frequently featured in interiors with flowers potted plants and floral and strawberry motifs on various mediums labor and handicrafts associated with the cottage lifestyle and the results from it are incredibly popular see activities for a list of full details animals found within the setting are another photographic subject the ones showcased are either domesticated animals such as cows cats dogs ducks rabbits and sheep or wild animals that would exist in the same field and forest setting such as frogs mice butterflies and squirrels these animals would be considered cute and are often in poses that carry across docility and relaxation for example cats sleeping on windowsills or frogs crossing their arms food is another important visual of the aesthetic the results of foraging baskets full of mushrooms berries and other fresh fruits celebrate the earth s bounty and the joy found in the activity baked goods bread and other sweet foods also contribute a cozy atmosphere to the aesthetic as it carries across the warmth and romantic labor associated with making it this is almost always traditional western fruit pies loaves of bread jars of jam and honey pancakes victoria sponges and other rustic cakes are the most common cottagecore celebrates a love of books books an outlet for fantasy and independent learning are frequent these are always vintage with a romantic storybook or classical feel with either antique leather and canvas or more approchable secondhand paperbacks in connection with this journals and letters are also considered part of the aesthetic as they convey the tenderness and intimacy associated with doing things with one s hands writing and reading will be expanded further in the activities section a comparison of different cottagecore illustrations left is cicely mary barker s illustrations right is lara hacker s illustration both are very different in style but carry across the cottagecore aesthetic another common medium of imagery of the aesthetic are illustrations botanical encyclopedias prior to the widespread use of colored photography are the most common these watercolors provide detailed views of plants typically flowers in a way that evokes both the natural subject and the romanticization of naturalists dedication to the subject matter during the era victorian to illustration specifically of children s literature is another important source of both inspiration and actual involvement in the aesthetic fairies and anthropromorphic animals such as those of beatrix potter s works are the most common these are done in a more detailed and naturalistic style in watercolor and ink however as cottagecore became popular artists who specialize in digital and more simplistic art introduced a flatter and more cute style cottagecore fashion tends to fall into either a hyper feminine modernized interpretation of historical fashion or a more practical and cozy outfit that includes some elements of whimsy cottagecore fashion commonly involves longer loose fitting flowy dresses and skirts often but not always reminiscent of housework wear from the large layered clothing as stated above big pockets puffy sleeves and button blousesnaturally occurring or faded colours including brown baby pink olive green ivory maroon beige ochre dusty rose pink light yellow and baby blue patterns such as stripes paisley faded floral and gingham embroidered plants animals and insects hand crafted accessories such as simple jewelry and knitted hats socks and outerwear shortalls overallslace longer loose fitting clothingthe hair and make up of cottagecore is either naturalistic or in more fantastical interpretations with fairy like motifs hair that is kept long is associated with tradition and femininity long hair that is loose tends to be in waves movies tv shows literature magazines youtube channels politics music artists playlist activities subgenres bloomcore is an aesthetic that is similar to cottagecore in many ways but has more of a centralized focus on flowers and gardening in a small quaint village cottagegore is a darker take on the cottagecore aesthetic with more of a focus on the more negative aspects of cottage and natural life that cottagecore often tries to veer away from honeycore is an aesthetic based around the rural production and consumption of goods such as honey bread and waffles it is similar to cottagecore in that agricultural imagery and values are emphasized but the visuals are streamlined to create a color palette of mostly pale yellows and browns in many of the pictures that can be classified into the honeycore aesthetic bees honey or flowers can be seen and there is a big emphasis on agriculture and conservation of bees southwest cottagecore moves away from the forest inspired green color palette of cottagecore the willows and vines are switched out with succulents the main aspects are quite identical just adapted to more southern western life instead of a stone cottage you may prefer an adobe house framed by yuccas the fashion becomes more suited for warm weather and is generally paired with warm colors and the occasional nautical whimsical look characterized by run down shacks on the coast and beach grass lizards rabbits snakes and hawks are characteristic of the aesthetic many critics of cottagecore point out that the trendification of rural practices and ways of life would be harmful to the environment high populations of settlers would overpopulate the areas ironically driving out the practices that cottagecore enthusiasts strive for for example foraging could not be supported if hundreds do it as the humans who do so would quickly exhaust the availability of the resources then as the berry bushes reduce in amount disrupting the ecosystem and causing possible ecological collapse not necessarily problematic but another valid criticism is the unrealistic fairy tale image of rural life some rural dwellers are exasperated with the ignorance of these internet users as the aesthetic does not display the difficult labor associated with farming animal husbandry and handicrafts this is especially contrasted with the visuals that are incongrous to the claims of self sufficiency by cottagecore enthusiasts english manors necessitate servants and groundskeepers gowns do not fit the agricultural lifestyle real farm equipment does not appear the materials cost money that could not be supported with small scale farming and crafts etc people concerned with farming rights also claim that over romanticization encourages an ignorant perspective on the actual lives of farmworkers which are incredibly difficult with back breaking labor and economic issues a false narrative of the farming lifestyle may encourage ignorance that patronizes the real lives of farmhands as the fans claim that they wish they were that occupational class the fact that cottagecore content creators create cottagecore content is also ironically contradictory to the aesthetic the things associated with social media such as having to build a brand tracking trends and even advertising the aesthetic are contrary to cottagecore emphasis on nature and disconnecting from these alienating websites in seeing cottagecore as a way to make content and have social media approval the messaging becomes a bit lost counterarguments claim that cottagecore is an outlet for fantasy the enthusiasts do not plan to actually move into these areas and survive on subsistance farming and experience hard labor instead they try to incorporate it through small activities that they could realistically achieve in their daily non rural lives the aesthetic does not cause socio economic issues and the critics claims are virtue signaling and cynical exaggeration that puts down the interests of women discourages diversity of interests and takes away from the virtues of the aesthetic however one extremely accurate issue is that the popularization of an aesthetic leads to commercialization that is not in line with the ethos of cottagecore sustainability as the fashion industry took note of the rising trend they kept up with demand through fast fashion practices that abuse the workers pollute the environment and take away from the labor of handmade and ethical fashion
