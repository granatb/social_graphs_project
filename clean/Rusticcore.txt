rusticcore is an aesthetic based about rustic themes or farms and is generally a romanticized version of rural living common themes in the aesthetic include old rusty items horses plants fairy lights and dark stained wood unlike cottagecore which has for the most part a cleaner look rusticcore openly embraces the grit dirt and grime that often is associated with farm life and rural living and giving it a sort of grunge vibe colors and clothing in the aesthetic include very plain fall colors warm colors along with plaid and denim a lot of rusticcore fashion shares some overlap with grunge since a lot of original grunge fashion was clothing that farmers and people like that wore because the clothing was intended to be long lasting to be able to handle the wear and tear of the rigors of working on the farm a lot of rusticcore music involves folksy acoustic music and has generally a loose improvisational feel to it like a bunch of friends gathered together on the front porch with whatever they could find and just have a jam session
