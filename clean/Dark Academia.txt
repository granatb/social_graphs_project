opposed to infographics on the advantages of different note styles dark academics wax poetically about the euphoria associated with finally mastering a language however social situations such as parties and being within a group are more than encouraged being drunk and having engaging conversations is a popular wish for dark academics to have and why many people bond over this aesthetic dinner parties coffee dates and picnics in the forest are a frequent outlet for this and wine coffee tea bread cheese and upscale traditional dishes are mentioned frequently in novels supernatural experiences and loss of control are activities that are wished for but not done due to their improbability there are frequent mentions of the bacchanal which was the inciting incident of the secret history where the characters experienced divine madness through ritual creative pursuits are also encouraged romanticism is linked with expressing emotions journaling acting in theater writing poetry and creating art are examples of this desire what makes these activities fit the aesthetic is how closely it aligns with the patrician and academic class of the eras for example expressing oneself through rap music or making drip paintings would not be considered dark academic but playing chopin s nocturnes or painting a naturalistic portrait of a lover would be visiting buildings that fit the dark academia visuals such as libraries art museums historic houses churches etc is another way of experiencing the aesthetic existing and daydreaming in the space taking note of the architecture and the people existing in it is in line with the romanticism of the ethos sports such as squash horse riding croquet and lacrosse can be claimed as dark academia due to their connection with preppy

games can have the same association hobbies that are not necessarily intellectually or emotion driven but have the appearance of the aesthetic are also included this includes calligraphy book binding and embroidery the emphasis on improving oneself dedication to a subject and active thinking and focus could be applied to these and many more hobbies again what determines if a hobby could fit into the aesthetic is its resemblance to the visuals and connotations the activities should fit the leisure class of the time periods for comedy s sake many dark academics banter about committing crimes such as murder art theft and blackmail aestheticization of unhealthy behavior western eurocentrism lack of true academic thought resources communities reddit discord servers dark academics
