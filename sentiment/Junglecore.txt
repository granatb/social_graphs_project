Junglecore is an aesthetic relating to the vibrant and mysterious ways of a jungle, which is usually filled with thriving habitats for native animals, plants, waterfalls, and other jungle sightings. It can also be related to exploring, and even researching or preservation of the jungle. Junglecore is also associated with creatures such as orangutans, Indian elephants, treefrogs, leopards, and many more. It is calming and exciting, natural and bold, practical and aspirational all at the same time. .Junglecore visuals are very tropical and full of life. The visuals show the jungle's greatest qualities such as:Jungle animalsRainforestsWaterfallsDense tropical plantsVinesTropical flowers and fruitsLeafy treesLarge and Colourful Insects.The fashion of junglecore could be divided into two categories. The first category would be of a jungle explorer, an individual who is a visitor to the biome and is journeying through it.Khaki-Coloured Clothes, or Clothes made of KhakiNatural/Sustainable materials such as hempBaggy Clothing with PocketsBags such as Fanny Packs, Satchels, Canvas BackpacksBinocularsA SunhatBandanaPractical Hairstyles such as PonytailsMinimal MakeupSunglassesHiking BootsLoose button-downsLoose shorts or hiking pantsEarth tonesThe second category would be of someone who calls the jungle their home, and finds the jungle to be their comfort zone. They have lived there for many years. Due to the prevalence of animal motifs, as well as conservation and naturalism as prominent inspiring values for the aesthetic, cruelty-free, sustainable, and synthetic faux-items may be preferred for things such as teeth, feathers, etc.   Dense botanicals and floralsBright, dark and bold colorsAnimal prints and motifsFeathersFloral, botanical, tropical printsAnimal TeethWooden Beads/JewelryBrightly-Coloured ClothVibrant Makeup/Face PaintNote: Cultural appropriation is morally wrong. Please do not copy the fashion of indigenous groups who live in any of the multiple jungles around the world. Instead, I encourage you to create your own designs, or buy from people who belong to the groups!.People with this aesthetic like down-to-earth and calming activities, as well as adventurous, exciting, and socially-conscious ones such as:Taking a nature walkNaturalismForagingAn interest in botany/any tropical speciesCollecting and caring for plants, especially tropical varietiesDocumenting species of plantsCollecting insectsDocumenting species of insectsPhotographyKeeping a journal of natural observationsHikingCaring for animalsConserving/Protecting natural areasCanoeingBird watchingClimbing trees/sitting in treesWaterfall hunting..Many movies take part in the Junglecore aesthetic, mostly from the adventure, action, fantasy/sci-fi and romance genres.
