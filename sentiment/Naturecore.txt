Naturecore is an aesthetic surrounding the theme of animals and other nature related things (ie. plants, forests, flowers, etc)..Naturecore visuals, unsurprisingly, focus a lot on nature and the idyllic and often romanticized version of being out in nature. Of course, that's not to stop Naturecore from going into some of the darker elements of nature (like the Cycle of Life, poisonous plants, and just the general struggle of the animal and plant kingdoms within nature), which can lead to some crossover with Vulture Culture.  Sometimes, though, it invites out a call for adventure to seek out the unknown..Nature printsBlooming flowersWreathsSustainable clothesOversized jumpersSweatersPlaid skirtsLong skirtsFlowy dressesDungareesOverallsCollared shirtPolo shirtsJeansBucket hats.Picking flowersReadingSketching plants and flowersCaring for plantsPressing leaves and flowersBakingCaring for animalsSowing/craftingVolunteering at an animal shelterMaking jewelry with acornsPhotography.External links to help get a better understanding of this aesthetic..MoonflowerCottagecore Aesthetic.faeries in nature (tea party with faeries) by jessienaturecore 🌱goblincore🍄cottagecore🕯 Spotify playlist by Rydernaturecore Spotify playlist by angelixpoetnaturecore // academia by maisnaturecore Spotify playlist by Emnaturecore 🍃🍂🕯 Spotify playlist by acabparadise Spotify playlist by louiecottagecore/naturecore !!
