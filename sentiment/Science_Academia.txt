Science academia, also known as STEM academia, is an academic aesthetic specializing in the formal, natural, and, to a lesser extent, social sciences. It differs from most other academic aesthetics, including the most popular in the category, which center on the arts and humanities. Science academia visuals vary among disciplines, but they share some common traits. Like many other academic aesthetics, science academia visuals are predominantly inspired by photographs from and paraphernalia prevalent in academic settings during the late 19th and early 20th century.The most popular branches of science presented in visuals and communities are mathematics, physics, chemistry, astronomy, microbiology, and human anatomy and physiology. Science academia is often described as dark academia applied to the sciences..Central to science academia philosophy are the values of the scientific method and the pursuit of knowledge. Discovery is your motive.Learning for the sake of learning.Stay curious and keep asking questions.Knowledge is found through experimentation.Nothing is impossible to discoverKnowledge is worth the risk.Staying up till 4 AM just to look out into the sky.Staying up till 4 AM to finish your thesis.Trolling greedy universities and publishers by copying the DOIs/URLs of journal artilces into Sci-HubRanting about this new advancements in your field to anybody who would listen.Ranting about the importance of your field to anybody who listens.Arguing about which discipline is the best/most importantSpending hours searching universities' libraries for science books to read in your spare time.Reading scientific articles not related to your specialty, for the taste of science.Science Fiction in any form.Playing chessAttending public lectures.Seeing if grad students and professors real academics or just NPCs.Writing a scientific article about your last research.Re-watching video lectures for the 100th time.Passionately debating theories and ideas.Being excited over the smallest interesting fact or smallest discoveryCorrecting people for small factual mistakesTheorizingGoing down research rabbit holesContributed knowledge to public edit-able documents (ex.

The main idea is anything comfortable for studying and doing experiments but with a more classical or uniform-like look for researchers and teachers.   Warm-tone, earthy, and dark colors, especially any brown or black shades, work for this aesthetic. Brighter pops of color like bright (or not so bright) reds, greens, yellows, blues and purples work as well.  .Print T-shirts, Texts, Any fandom print or Solid color.Polo shirtsButton downsWork-type blousesLab coatsCoats in general (trench coats, overcoats, etc)BlazersSweaters, turtle-neck sweaters, and anything for cold and rainy weatherAnything with pockets.Any comfortable pants, (Jeans, Trousers, looser pants)Suit pantsSkirts (mid/long length, plaid, pencil, or anything with great mobility)Cigarette pantsPinafores.Boots (ankle boots, Dr. Martens, Combat bootsOxfordsMary JanesKnee high socksSolid colour tightsSneakersKitten heels.Satchel/tote bag to hold your books, chess board, journal, computer, etc.WatchesHair tiesThick beltsGlasses/GogglesSimple jewelryEnamel pins to decorate your stuffAnything simple and small...Alexandra WorkwearMedisaveBetter EquippedNothing but safety glasses.TeePublicRedBubbleShenova FashionScienceWear 	 	 	 		 		 		 			Cambridge Public Library 		 	 .Universities and collegesOld libraries and bookstoresStudying in rainy/cold weather (and feeling mysterious)Indoor spacesAny time between 10 pm and 6 amMuseumsMessy DesksStudying a very specific question from the lecture during breaksOld storesTelescope observatoriesNotebooks filled up to the edge with equations and writingsScience fictionVideo LecturesHistoric sites and locationsHistoric towns and citiesOld townsA dark linoleum-tiled hallwayGlass vial topped with a rubber stopperMad scientists and inventive chemistsPeriodic tableA computer with many tabs openAstronomy mapsGlobes and mapsA room plastered with postersLong summer road trips to see something obscureWindows open to get your only fresh air for the dayStretching while not getting off your seat..RedditQuoraResearchGateSci-HubYouTubeChess.com.Natural sciencesHank GreenWhisper of the heartX-FilesContact (Carl Sagan)Contact (1997)A Beautiful Mind (2001)Creation (2009)Any Star Wars filmA Dangerous Method (2011)The Theory of Everything (2014)Interstellar (2014)Experimenter (2015)Hidden Figures (2016)Westworld (2016- )Any video lectures in your fieldChaotic Academia: A Noir Robotics MysteryDr. StoneAny Star trek filmSpace ForceMythbustersASAP Science (YouTube)Numberphile (YouTube)Sam O'Nella Academy (YouTube)Social SciencesDystopia - 1984, cyberpunk, Snow Piercer, Hunger Games, Mad Max, etc.Death of a Salesman by Arthur MillerAdam Ruins Everything (TV Show)The Handmaid's Tale (TV Show)Richard D.
