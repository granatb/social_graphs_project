They are boys who are unafraid of showing off their sensitive and artistic sides with the clothing that they choose to wear. They have become one of the more known aesthetics, despite female counterparts typically being more popular. Softboys also have quite a negative reputation, related to the fact that some Softboys fake their soft sides. Among trans boys, Softboys typically have a bit of a different meaning and style and tend to be more genuine. The Softboy also has ties to the Art Hoe. Softboys have been said to be influenced by K-Pop..The Softboy does appear to wear pastel colors (optional) but is also know to wear more muted but still darker tones. Otherwise, they adopt a similarly vintage-themed fashion style like their Softgirl counterparts.

This is a color and environment-based aesthetic, focusing on oceans, light, and pastel cool-tone colors..While Oceanboy tends to still use pastels from time to time, darker, cooler color palettes are preferred. Beaches, water, or docks are all common, but not essential..Oceanboy tends to be a bit brighter than Softboy, as to really bring out the cooler colors.
