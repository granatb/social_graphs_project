Hipster is a subculture that is stereotypically composed of young adults who reside primarily in gentrified neighborhoods. It is broadly associated with indie and alternative music and genres, such as chill-out, folk, modern rock, pop rock and post-Britpop. Hipsters also frequently flaunt a varied non-mainstream fashion sensibility, wearing vintage and thrift store-bought clothing; hold pacifist and green views; are often vegan; consume organic and artisanal foods, and craft alcoholic beverages; and live alternative lifestyles. The roots of the hipster aesthetic date back to the 1940s, but the modern-day version did not reach the height of its popularity until the late 2000s or early 2010s..Under Construction.Hipster Fashion revolves around the idea of rejecting the 'mainstream' trends and utilizing unique or 'quirky' items to define an outfit.

This applies to people who wear child-like clothing, acts in a way that invokes cuteness or anything of the sort. This is what it looks like when one takes the Kidcore aesthetic and added a few dashes into the Hipster aesthetic..A Fixed Gear Hipster (or fixie hipster) describes a hipster riding atop a fixed gear bicycle often termed as a fixie. Although, the heritage of fixed gear cycling dates to professional couriers, messengers, and track cycling. It is unclear how this style of cycling became popular with them. However, it is generally believed that owning a fixed-gear bicycle has been labeled "trendy" within hipster culture..
