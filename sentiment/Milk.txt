The Milk aesthetic is largely revolved round the look of everyday milk cartons and bottles, mainly focusing on color and minimalistic styling of containers. Milk can be split off into various subgenres based off color/flavor. Subgenres can also be applied using other aesthetics like grunge, which can include darker colors and darker imagery. Milk's aesthetic is mostly soft and not far off from babycore or kidcore. Milk aesthetic can also apply to milk tea, and others things with similar flavours. .Milk cartonsMilk bottles, glass and plasticDrinking glasses and mugsStrawsKorean and Japanese wordsPastel colorsCartoon art stylesGrocery store milk aisles.Milk fashion stems from softie, babycore, and kawaii.
