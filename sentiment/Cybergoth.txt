Cybergoth is a subculture that derives from elements of Goth, Raver, Rivethead, and Cyberpunk subcultures. Cybergoths are often considered part of the industrial subculture, and not the Goths (if due to the fact the Goths have absolutely no love for the Cybergoths whatsoever).Some people don't think Cybergoth is a subculture in itself, but more of a variation in aesthetic on cyberpunk or raver fashion. Cyber Kei would be a Japanese substyle that mixes it with elements of Visual Kei..The term 'Cybergoth' was coined in 1988 by Games Workshop for their roleplaying game. But the fashion style didn't exist until a decade later. Julia Borden defines cybergoth as combining elements of industrial aesthetics with "gravers" (gothic ravers).The gothic-club Slimelight in London is often named as the first place where cybergoths manifested. Around 2001, the combination of neon clothing/hair with black clothes was common in that club.The Cybergoth aesthetic did have its moment in the sun thanks to a video going viral in the earlier days of YouTube that has since gone on to become a staple in meme culture (if for all the wrong reasons). 	 	 	 			   	 	 		 		 			Cybergoth Dance Party 		 		 			The most famous Cybergoth video on the internet. 		 	 Since this video has been made, however, the Cybergoth subculture only seemed to further decline in popularity; something that could partially be linked to an overall decline in popularity of most goth-themed aesthetics in current times, but that doesn't leave out the possibility that Cybergoth could see a resurgence in the near future (a la the Club Kids resurgence), especially with Raver culture becoming more and more popular in the mainstream. but only time will tell in that regard..Cybergoth is based around flurescent colors and uses pvc, vinyl, and other artifical looking materials in order to create a futuristic looking style. The hair is dyed in unnatural colors and adorned with colorful hair pieces, also known as cyberlox, which can be made of wool, foam, rubber or fabrics.
