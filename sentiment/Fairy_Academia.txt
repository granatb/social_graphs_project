Fairy Academia is a feminine, otherworldly offshoot of Dark Academia, inspired by the aesthetics of Victorian and Edwardian childhood.Fairy academics enjoy learning and education, as well as trickery and scheming - as in the 1917 Cottingley Fairy hoax, where two young girls used trick photography to con the populace into thinking there were real fairies in their garden..Fairy Academia is an aesthetic that was identified/created by wiki user Fairypage. It is a combination of an identified and a created aesthetic wherein the main inspiration and visuals are based on a series of inter-related events and design movements, but was created in that categories relating to lifestyle and the music associated with the aesthetic are unrelated to the original Victorian/Edwardian time period, such as the grunge elements listed in the music section..Victorian fairytale ephemeraBallet visualsVictorian and Renaissance-era paintingsHole - Violet (Official Music Video)Country Love - Mono (Official Music Video).Picnic at Hanging Rock by Joan LindsayA Little Princess by Frances Hodgson BurnettThe Secret Garden by Frances Hodgson BurnettPeter and Wendy by J.M.
