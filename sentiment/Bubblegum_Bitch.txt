Bubblegum Bitch is characterized by bright colors, especially pink, and to a lesser extent purple and white, which combines feminine and childlike aspects of fashion with teenage and adult self-expression. Bubblegum Bitch was strongly influenced by 2000s American pop culture, and takes some visual and philosophical inspiration from McBling.  A point of confusion is parody artwork and clothing featuring cartoon characters like Hello Kitty or Barbie but using swear words or referencing sex. Because of this, these things are not technically Sanriocore or Barbiecore, but in fact Bubblegum Bitch..Bubblegum bitch fashion generally uses highly saturated colors, particularly pink, purple, and white, and stereotypically feminine style. Fashion sometimes features typically "innocent" and/or pretty characters like the Bratz Dolls, Powerpuff Girls, Jigglypuff, Hello Kitty, Barbie, My Little Pony characters, and various others. Typically "childish" accessories and accents like barrettes, glitter, hair ties, and candy jewelry are sometimes used. These are often paired with more serious and adult style choices, like chokers, chains, swear words, statements relating to politics, mental health, romance, and sex.  .Pink clothingIridescent clothingGlittery clothingTulleClothing featuring innocent, pretty characters (which are often targeted towards children)Clothing with words or statementsTank topsCrop topsDyed and stylized jean jacketsMini-skirtsKnee socksHeeled shoesStilettos.SunglassesChokersChildren's watchesEarringsBarrettesHair bowsAcrylic nailsWigs and extensions.Victoriaâ€™s SecretDollsKillFila.GlitterLipstickLip glossTattoos, temporary or notWinged eyelinerFalse eyelashesDyed hair and/or highlights..Pink is the most significant color in the Bubblegum Bitch aesthetic.RedPinkHot pinkLight pinkWhiteBlack.BlueYellowCyanPurple.BubblesConfettiGlitterGoldTulleFruit patterns like strawberries and cherriesDotsHeart-shaped dotsStar-shaped dotsPolka dots.This is a list of object visuals associated with the bubblegum bitch aesthetic:Anime artPinkHeartsBubblegumCandySweet foodsStylized profanityStylized quotesChildren's toys, especially toys marketed toward young girlsChildren's TV shows and characters such as Hello Kitty, Jigglypuff, and The Powerpuff GirlsBold fontsHair bowsCloudsGlitterRecordsRollerskating and rollerbladingCrystalsBalloonsFlowersBratz DollsCherriesStrawberries.Bubblegum Bitch media is more jaded and sexual than Barbiecore but it lacks the hard partying and drug culture of McBling..Grease (1978)Heathers (1988)Jawbreaker (1999)Uptown Girls (2003)D.E.B.S.
