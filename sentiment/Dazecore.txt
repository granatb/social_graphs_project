Dazecore is an aesthetic inspired by sleepless nights and the buzz of late night/early morning thoughts. It is very closely linked to Urbancore, Geek, and Dark Minimalism, heavily influenced by artists working in the early hours of the morning and students staying up late at night working on papers. The origin of Dazecore appears to be on @the_niche_cliche on Instagram, on the 19th of May, 2020.   .A lot of elements of Dazecore can cross over into the After Hours aesthetic, but viewed through more of a Dreamy lens.Softly glowing screens in dark roomsLo-Fi music, crackling through broken headphonesStacks of notebooks with scribbles in the marginTime seeming to slow down around 3amRacing thoughts and shaking handsUnknown footsteps on creaky stairsLate-night texts to loved onesReoccurring dreams of falling endlessly.A lot of the fashion from Dazecore borrows heavily from the Cuddle Party aesthetic, but while Cuddle Party is more about laid back and good times with your friends, Dazecore has a slightly surreal bent to itOversized, comfortable sweaters and hoodiesSoft, fluffy jumpersMuted color tonesSimple makeup and messy hairFlowing, wide-legged trousersMatching sets and pajamas, in soft and cozy fabrics.Dazecore music tends to include Lo-Fi music. .its 1am and i still miss you3 A.
