Brocore (or bro culture) is a subculture of young men who spend time partying with others like themselves. Although the popular image of bro lifestyle is associated with sports apparel and fraternities, it lacks a consistent definition..Most aspects of Brocore can vary regionally, it can blend in with the Surfer culture of California, the Redneck culture of the Southeast, the Preppy culture of New England, the Chav culture of England, et cetera. Brocore guys may often be seen around some Baddies or older members of Brocore may find themselves with a Karen on their hands..Brocore visuals feature things that will typically get the adrenaline pumping and the testosterone flowing; fast and/or loud cars, sports, guys getting drunk, ogling beautiful women, and occasionally getting into fights in an attempt to establish the bro-hierarchy in a particular troop of Bros.  When the Bro is pacified, he can be generally be well-meaning and laid-back, but if the Bro is angered (or incredibly drunk) it might be best to stay away from the Bro at all costs..Brocore fashion features cargo shorts or pants, jean shorts (or "jorts"), sportswear, camouflage patterns, baseball caps, and t-shirts or hoodies emblazoned with the Monster Energy Drink logo. Brocore's fashion is generally similar to Normcore (although Normcore is going for a completely different vibe).  But while the Bro generally just wants to hang out, have a few drinks, and watch the game, some Bros have a tendency to get super aggressive at the drop of a hat.
