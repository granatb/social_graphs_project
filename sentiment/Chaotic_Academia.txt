Chaotic Academia is an aesthetic that involves haphazard routines, messy habits, unusual or banned literature, and studying with a passion. This subtype of Academia promotes the acceptance of messy or seemingly uncomposed traits some students may have..Chaotic Academia can be defined as:An academia movement that welcomes the disconnection between appearance and personality. The aim is to normalise and humanise the academic aesthetic and reclaim it from the elitism of days gone by.This aesthetic intends to focus on the process of learning instead of stressing over looks and trying to perfect one's secondary aspects, like fashion.Chaotic Academia acknowledges the pretentiousness of classic academia, subtly mocking it at times. Nevertheless, as an academic subculture, it participates in it as well. Chaotic academics know this, and embrace it..Chaotic Academia originated with the text post from tumblr user chiafett-main saying, "Chaotic academia is 1.) Intense obsessions that last maybe two weeks but consume your soul 2.) Spacing out in class but loving to learn 3.) Swearing and slang while discussing deep academic topics". This was posted on September 27, 2019, at the same time as the popularization of Dark Academia and the aesthetic variations being built off of this, such as with Light Academia..The idea is to accept and stop judging the less visually pleasing or perfectly performed tasks and processes. Unlike some other genres, it doesn't inherently agree to follow the rules and implies some visual or behavioral variety from the all-accepted idea of the prim and proper academics. Be yourself, have fun, and enjoy studying. For some, the floor is the best place to study, people can lack time management, scrawl poetry on a napkin, and not in a notebook, use vandalism for help on an exam, and have anarchism quotes all over notes. And it's fine!..Chaotic academia books fall under 2 categories: banned literature, and books that weren't banned but are still chaotic (in a good way) in their own right. For instance, Ella Minnow Pea wasn't widely banned, but as the book goes along, the author stops using certain letters of the alphabet..Anything written by Oscar WildeAnything written by Dan BrownAnything written by Edgar Allan PoeAnything written by Douglas AdamsAnything written by Sylvia PlathAnimal Farm by George OrwellBrave New World by Aldous HuxleyCarry On by Rainbow RowellDoctor Zhivago by Boris PasternakDracula by Bram StokerThe Harry Potter series by J.K.

Some activities it's associated with are:Performing rituals in class with books and other thingsSpending days on the grounds of the schoolHanding in homework at the last minuteSchool uniforms getting torn or being dirtyFood fightsStudy parties at 1 amSneaking out of school or skipping classReciting useless factsDrinking cold teaReading banned booksLeaving annotations in the margins of library books (bonus points if they're memes)Always losing your pensCovering your bedroom wall in sticky notesDiscussing conspiracies about Shakespeare with your friendsCollecting foreign books that are in a language you don't understandIntense and quick obsessions that consume your soul (and ranting to your friends about them 24/7)Spacing out in classDrinking tea or coffee from shot glasses or drinking liquor from teacupsSwearing and slang while discussing deep academic topicsEmptying your pockets at the end of the day and coming to a total of four pens, a pocket notebook, two receipts, and a highlighterUsing a rubber band to tie your hair backTaking a "quick break", then waking up in the middle of the nightDrinking energy drinks from vintage teacupsStealing school property, although this is discouragedGoing out during a break in the rain deliberately to get wetPutting your feet up on the desk while you think with your pen behind your earSneaking into the library after hours to "borrow" restricted fictionStanding on desksWriting too many unorganized and uncoordinated annotationsAggressively mouthing lyrics to blaring music while studyingFidgeting around with suppliesScattering papers across the desk or floorChoosing to train home alone when friends were easily accessibleSleeping late every night due to neverending thoughts.The style doesn't have to be strictly formal and proper. The uniform should be fun! You can mess with a shirt a little, altering it to one's liking, and cut and fix it in different places. Convenience and comfort are a priority. Anything school-related or quick and easy will do. Be yourself!Some of these examples are:Button downs open over logo tee shirtsMessy eyelinerHeavy bootsMismatched socksThe same hoodie or sweater every dayPatched or torn clothesToo many cardigans and sweatersSchool uniform but worn incorrectly; neckties around heads, ripped stockingsLarge blazersSandals or crocs (when you‚Äôre too lazy to put on boots)JeansUntied lacesLeg warmersOversized Earth tone Sweaters.
