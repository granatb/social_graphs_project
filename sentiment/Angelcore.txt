Angelcore is a contemporary aesthetic inspired by imagery and depictions of angels, and is adjacent to devilcore. The aesthetic is designed to emulate the same unearthly beauty that European angels are described and depicted with, though it can also include non-European angel aesthetics. This can be done with modern or older presentation methods. The Angelcore aesthetic is not always explicitly religious and sometimes involves sacrilege. Users of these aesthetic are not necessarily religious. .GoldCupidPinkGlitterKeysButterfliesFlowers, especially rosesSmall, ornate patternsHeartsMirrorsThe skyCloudsLightWingsHarpsHalosTearsReflectionsHighlights & shadowsCherubsColumns.A list of external links to help get a better understanding of this aesthetic..‚Äî angelcore by vinnyü•Äangelcore by d a i s yangelcore by babyangelcore by mars.mp4Aesthetic ‚ô¶Ô∏é Angelcore ‚ô¶Ô∏é by SilverzAngelcore by Maggie.M¬∞ angelcore by faedearest.Silk and sheer fabricsLaceFeathersLong, flowing, light clothingNightgowns and coordsFlowers and floral patterned clothingCrossesRosariesBallet flatsLight or natural makeupFake halos and fake wingsDressesJewellery.Angel cakeCoconutMeringues..The Sacrifice (1986)Wings of Desire (1987)Faraway, So Close!

Cherubcore focuses on the feelings and values portrayed by heavenly cherubs and the small, sweet, baby-like innocence of the figures that differ from the divine essence of angels. There is often a distinct crossover in this aesthetic with Angelcore and Babycore, with a hint of Lovecore now and then due to the similarity between cherubs and the mythical figure Cupid. The visuals of cherubcore are the same as angelcore but add more fun visuals like candy, cherubs laughing in paintings, hearts, porcelain figures, and child's toys. There are lots of pinks and whites involved as well. Fashion has a very similar overlap to Nymphet and Babycore, with youthful and childlike articles of clothing and accessories..The Fallen Angel aesthetic, also known as dark/goth angelcore, takes angelcore and adds more somber themes and dark visual tones while still providing the essences of ethereal and other-worldy. Many of the themes of fallen angel involve feelings of "falling from grace" or unworthiness/not wanting to be placed on a pedestal like angels are commonly portrayed. The aesthetic itself can both exude feelings of peace and radiance or sorrow and malice depending on the camp presented.  Common motifs for fallen angels include angel statues, black wings, flowing white and/or black fabrics, fire, halos, horns and tails, the sky and the ground, snakes, and much more. Visually, there is a crossover with Dark Naturalism, which exhibits dark, misty visuals of nature. Other visuals can overlap with Traumacore and Grunge, employing angelic motifs mixed with heavy melancholy themes. Fashion takes regular angelcore and turns it black, almost gothic. It can also take an aforementioned Grunge route.  This aesthetic can focus on criticizing the Catholic religion, sharing similar aspects of reasoning with Sacricore. Common topics include excommunication, religious trauma, and mental illness. Often this is mixed with the aforementioned feelings of falling from grace or feeling tainted, and potentially being cast out of a religion or choosing to leave it.  .The Shadowhunter Chronicles by Cassandra ClareThe Infernal DevicesThe Dark ArtificesCity of Bones (2013).dark angelcore by raphaelDark angelcore aesthetic by Maddyfallen angel by siennafallen angel by alexisFallen Angel Aesthetic by Artemis.fallen // angel by taste in musicfallen angels by lillian :)fallen angels. by milkynoirextinguish me by soap&skinfairytale by kalafina.Seraphimfall on Tumblrblack-feathers-float on Tumblrangelic-riot on Tumblr.Biblical Angels are taken from the biblical depiction of angels, rather than the altered humanistic version created by the media. There are various sections of the Bible where angels and cherubs are described, including Ezekiel 1:5-11, Isaiah 6:2, Job 38:7, Ps 8:5, Ac 26:13, and Re 1:20. These verses and many others describe angels as hot, pure energy, and frightening to humans. This is a popular subject in art and can be seen across media. Often times they are depicted as half human, half animal or as energy balls with a thousand eyes circling around it with six wings. This subject focuses on the reality of divinity and the terrifying truth that had been covered up by mainstream society over history. The overall theme of the biblical angel aesthetic is questionsing monstrosity and fear, and presenting truth to those living in ignorance. It is both ethereal and horrifying, and has a subcommunity for those who identify with these depictions. These communities also use their art of biblical angels to portray the previously mention themes, as well as humor. Being ethereal and mysterious, feeling "too big your body", and a deep philosophical nature can accompany the moods of this aestheic.  .biblical angels/seraphim by ann_dvach  Biblical angels by Kaylinne  biblical angels by M.tomato-bird on Tumblrserrangelic-art on tumblrcherriielle on tumblr"Ah yes, biblically accurate angels" Facebook group.
