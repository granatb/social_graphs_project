Kawaii Gamer is a version of Kawaii that is popular amongst gamers, Twitch streamers, and anime fans, particularly ones who use TikTok and are Gen Z. It also was influenced by E-Girl culture and Lo-Fi, aesthetics that rose around 2020. This differs from other forms of Kawaii in that it contains specific merchandise, room decor, and fashion trends that are more aligned with the Western interpretation of Japan and Korea and show an increased globalization as different media reach a larger audience. The objects common in the aesthetic are incredibly replicated, and multiple TikToks are dedicated to showing the set-ups of a Kawaii gamer.
