Thank you.Erokawa (エロカワ) is a japanese aesthetic that is supposed to contrast the popular kawaii trends by drawing notions of the western concept of sexiness. The term, coined in 2005, is a fusion of ero (shortened from the English word "erotic", which has negative connotations in Japanese culture) and the lighter kawaii, meaning "cute".Nowadays, it mostly refers to anything erotic that was inspired by kawaii culture..The term was first used in public by the japanese singer Kumi Kōda as erokakkoii (エロかっこいい, "erotic cool") to describe her artistic style. Many japanese women considered the word ero as something negative but found it acceptable to associate the word with kakkoii. Kumi gave further variations such as erokakkokawaii or the more well-known erokawa. With the increasing popularity of the singer in the following years 2006 and 2007, the term spread more and more artists such as the korean singer Ayumi Lee or Leah Dizon described Kumi as their influence in relation to fashion..pink ecchi/hentai manga editsheart locksfashion harnesskawaii lingeriecat ears..GradNCNightcore.External links to help get a better understanding of this aesthetic..Atelier SEmuprojectInvasion ClubPredatorratParfaiteMoe Flavor.
