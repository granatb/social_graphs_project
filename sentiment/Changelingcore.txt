Changelingcore is an aesthetic that borrows ideas from Goblincore, holding the same idea of mischief, as well as loving the parts of nature that are shunned by others. The aesthetic also holds onto a degree of melancholy, tying back into its original creation for the Neurodivergent community and the stigma/misunderstanding that often comes with it. Changelingcore was originally coined by (now-deactivated) Tumblr user willow-o-the-wisp as a subcategory of Faecore that is exclusively for Neurodivergent people, for example, people who are Autistic, or who have ADHD, DID, etc..Being barefootFairy ringsBig heavy coatsMossCollections (Possibly strange)Uncanny valleyCute things with a hint of eeriness (i.e. a teddy bear with too many eyes)Liminal SpacesComfort Object/s that you take everywhereHomemade JewelryDoodles everywhere and anywhereClutterStimming!Shiny things/ ShiniesStompy ShoesEccentric outfits with lots of layersDark waters.Going to the woods/the sea/hilltops/paddock muttering a phrase or counting under your breath the entire way there.
