Vintage Parisian is a feminine aesthetic that takes influence from mid-twentieth century Paris and similar cities like New York and London, luxury brands, and old Hollywood movies. The participants emphasize the importance of self-care, romanticizing small pleasures in life, and cultivating a sophisticated and kind personality. This aesthetic was embodied by the original films, advertisements, and brands, and was later collected into moodboards and blogs by women on tumblr, and later tiktok. While it does resemble other luxury-based aesthetics such as Boujee, its hyper-feminine presentation, vintage lifestyle elements, and lack of necessity to actually purchase luxury items distinguishes itself from others..Architectural photosBags and boxes from designer brandsBallet dancingChandeliersClips of Old Hollywood moviesLingerie, both on people and in stock photosMakeup, both on a person's face and in the packagingNotes about lovePeople in lovePhotos of runway detailsRoses, peonies, and other romantic flowersStreets of ParisSweets in attractive packaging or with pink toppingsWinter photographs.
