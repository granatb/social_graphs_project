Art Academia is an Academic aesthetic centered around the creation and enjoyment of art, including sculpture, painting, sketch, doodling, photography, and calligraphy. It is similar to Light Academia and Dark Academia in its value of studying, dedicated practice of learned interests, 18-19th century-inspired aesthetics, and architecture, but is unique in focusing primarily on the visual arts. .Art academia is centered primarily around the visual arts, and as such is primarily a visual aesthetic. Color schemes are generally warm and neutral with bright colors either scattered throughout or focused to draw the viewers' attention. Popular visuals include (but may not be limited to):SculpturePre-modern sculptureGreekRomanSketchesDoodlesDiagramsCalligraphyCartologyStylized cartographyPhotographsArchitecturePlaces of learningUniversitiesMuseums.People who partake in this aesthetic typically study at a college or a university, and therefore have to choose from a variety of subjects. Students choose specific courses to suit their future career or personal interest. Some of them include:CeramicsDrawingColour TheoryPerspectiveGraphic DesignHistory of ArtPaintingPrint MakingSculptureVisual ArtsWater ColorAnimationTypographyWorld Arts.Generally, all activities are somehow related to learning about art or interacting with it. Of course, it can be done in different forms, such as:Walking through museums and galleriesAttending life drawing classesDrawing in generalCreating art pieces (e.g. charcoal portraits)Writing creativelyAdmiring architecture and the ageless faces of statuesReading booksListening to musicJournalingPlaying musicPaintingAttending playsAttending the theaterAnalyzing filmsPhotography.What you wear doesn't matter as long as you have an interest in studying arts and attend an educational department. Presumably, as for many students, comfort and availability are prioritised. Maybe having a couple of pockets to carry some paint tubes and brushes, or a ponytail, so the hair doesn't touch the canvas sound reasonable.
