Romantic Italian is an aesthetic built upon the romanticism of the culture of Italy, particularly its idyllic countrysides, rich history, fashion culture, and languid society. The participants of this aesthetic place a great importance on appreciation of the arts and the luxurious lives of the Italian nobility, such as in masked balls. The aesthetic is able to blend the cosmopolitan Renaissance cities of Florence, Rome, and Venice with the countryside. Luxury is also an important part of the aesthetic, as activities associated with the leisure class, such as buying luxury goods and frequent traveling, are frequent subjects of these photos. It often overlaps with Vintage Parisian, but its regional focus, emphasis on Classicism, and the addition of rural, almost Cottagecore, stylings distinguishes it from its French counterpart.  .Baroque, Pre-Raphaelite, and Renaissance styled paintingsBeaches and the oceanCafésCharcuterie plattersDesigner fashion goods from Italian brands such as Prada and GucciFarms, fields, and forests of ItalyFresh fruit such as figs, peaches, and grapesInteriors of Italian palaces, cathedrals, and museumsLove-related media, such as quotes, plays, and booksPhotos of runway detailsPhysically attractive men and women, sometimes nudeRomeo and Juliet themed imageryStreets of Italian cities, such as Rome and VeniceSunsets and sunrisesVintage carsWhite marble sculpture.White linen blousesOff-the-shoulder topsLoose, flowing skirtsSilk slip dressesHaute couture gownsSandalsPatterned scarves, like Audrey Hepburn in Roman HolidayDelicate jewelryFloral hair arrangementsStraw hats.Boating in the Italian rivieraGoing to historical cities and buildingsPicnickingReading poetryRiding on a Venetian gondolaShopping at a farmers marketSketching daily life..Call Me by Your Name (2017)Houseboat (1958)Letters to Julliet (2010)Made In Italy (2020)Much Ado About Nothing (1993)Roman Holiday (1953)Romeo and Juliet (1968)Only You (1994)Three Coins in the Fountain (1954)The Lizzie McGuire Movie (2003)Under the Tuscan Sun (2003)Viola de mare (2009)Spring (2014).Call Me by Your Name by André AcimanLove & Gelato by Jenna Evans WelchUnder the Tuscan Sun by Frances Mayers..
