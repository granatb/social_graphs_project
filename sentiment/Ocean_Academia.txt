Ocean Academia is an Academia aesthetic that revolves around the fascination, dark understanding, and scientific pursuit of marine education. This involves specializations such as oceanography, marine biology, marine archaeology, ocean engineering, hydrology, naval architecture, etc.This aesthetic mainly centers around one's passion for learning about the deep ocean, sea mythology, marine life, and mysteries of the abyss. At a deeper level, it signifies a quest for self-discovery, meaning of life, and emotional peace.This aesthetic is not derived from any particular culture, society, trend, or period of time. Hence, it is more open to personal touches and individualistic desires. It is a romanticization of the ocean's depth and darkness, as well as the unknown that lies beyond. .Ocean Academia was created by SirenInTheBathtub for the Aesthetics Wiki..At its heart, Ocean Academia aims to express the the inexplicable mystery that the ocean holds, its secretive yet inviting nature and the evocation of abstract emotions.

How can we imagine specific pictures, dresses or free-time activities? There are several sub-genres of this aesthetic which resolve the fact that water destroys books.blue version of dark (or light) academia: pearl accessories, waving blue silk robes, black, white and blue tapestry or furniture, paintings about the sea on the wall etc., otherwise nothing special: studying people, libraries, museums, books, literature, literacy...vacation-of-the-librarian: moodboards that contain reading persons on the beach, on the rocks of a seashore or on boatsVenice: university cities built on the sea or lakes, where the streets are often canals, the residents do not walk but use gondolas or boats for transportation. Can be a historically accurate (Venice, Bruges, Wroclaw etc.) or fantasy environment.wise mermaids: fantasy subgenre where the entire 'landscape' is underwater and the intelligent species (mermaids, sirens, tritons, nixies, sea elf communities etc.) found a way how to write or perpetuate their knowledge in the deepcontemporary: contemporary sub-culture of those scholars, oceanographers, researchers and artists who study the seas or inspired by the seafuturistic: a subgenre that supposes a future where cities are built on or under the sea. It can be an optimistic fiction close to solarpunk where mankind had learnt how to live in harmony with nature (The Deep - animation series) but can be a darker universe too e.g. like the post-apocalyptic Waterworld film (1995)...SwimmingRecreational divingSurfingUnderwater photography.Ocean documentariesMythologyMidnight researchReadingDrinking teaCooking seafoodCollecting seashellsPhilosophy booksStudy underwater ruinsObsessing over supernatural marine mysteriesCollecting marine fossilsHistoryDrawing marine anatomyForeign languagesPainting seascapesListening to deep sea ambienceNautical ChartsFluteSea PoetryContemporary dancingJournalingDreaming.Art galleriesMuseumsTheatresAquariumsBeach barsLibrariesBookshops.
