Mosscore is an aesthetic that focuses on forest and moss related things and objects. The main focus is dark, mossy forests and sometimes things like fungi and liverworts are prevalent. The main colour scheme is mostly various, usually dark, shades of green, browns and other natural hues, and light/bright colours almost never pop up. Man made objects in this aesthetic include, but are not limited to, shacks, huts and cabins. This aesthetic is closely related to other forest-themed aesthetics like Forestpunk, Cottagecore, and Mushroomcore. .Many aesthetics can be achieved via activities. Some examples of mosscore activities would be:Collecting moss samplesKeeping a journalGathering wild fruitReading old nature booksBird watchingBuilding birdhousesCollecting flora/fauna (mostly bugs)Long walks in the woodsPicnics on moss-covered rocksAny activity that is related to observing or creating things with nature quietly.External links to help get a better understanding of this aesthetic..mosscore by maria ðŸŒ¿Mosscore by Core Suffix| mosscore | by Asi :)mosscore by charmosscore by mara.Mosscore fashion is similar to Dark Academia and Cryptidcore, but with a comfier twist (eg, plaid pants and a skirt with oxfords and a large dark green sweater and rolled down socks.)
