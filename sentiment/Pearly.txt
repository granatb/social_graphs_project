Pearly is an aesthetic that is themed around the pearl gem and sometimes the colour white as well. A sort of heavenly vibe is also incorporated. A lot of people who go for this aesthetic go for the goddess white vibe, but some go for more of the oceans vibe. This aesthetic can be closely tied in with both Nautical and Angelcore because of its pure and heavenly vibe. It also has Boujee inspirations, taking expensive clothing and experiences and making them seem more immortal and elegant. It can also be paired with Crystalcore as it pertains to some jewelry worn within the Pearly aesthetic. Pearly also tends to have fancier fashion, as pearls can be quite expensive. ..Pearly fashion tends to have a strong focus on whites and pastel colors (much like their namesake) with some shiny and shimmery items thrown in.
