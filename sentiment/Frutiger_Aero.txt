Frutiger Aero is an aesthetic that was prevalent from roughly 2004 to 2012. Frutiger Aero is characterized by its use of skeuomorphism, glossy textures, use of nature and humanism, use of bright and vibrant colours (usually contrasted on a white or monochrome background), and use of glass. This aesthetic was used in the technology and visual design of the time, and is often associated with the early days of Web 2.0.Frutiger Aero is similar to the Y2K aesthetic and can be considered its successor, as it shares a similar bright and glossy futuristic look. Frutiger Aero was also concurrent with the McBling & Surf Crush aesthetic, and overlaps with them in some respects. By 2012â€“13, the skeuomorphic look of Frutiger Aero (i.e. iOS 6, Windows 7) had started to fade in favor of the Cyber Minimalism/Blob Web look (i.e. iOS 7, Windows 8)..Frutiger Aero visuals, at first glance, could be mistaken for simply being the Y2K aesthetic in action, but the biggest difference is that the images tend to have a higher definition visual compared to a lot of the Y2K aesthetics (largely due to it coming around just as HD started to become popular). The Frutiger Aero visuals also lack the sort of "playfulness" often associated with the Y2K aesthetic, going for more of a "clean" and professional look. The Frutiger Aero look was the "halfway point" between the busyness of the Y2K era and the Cyber Minimalist/Blob Web approach of 2013 and beyond..External links to help get a better understanding of this aesthetic.https://www.are.na/froyo-tam/frutiger-aerohttps://cari.institute/aesthetics/frutiger-aerohttps://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingIsAnIPodInTheFuturehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Aerohttps://www.reddit.com/r/FrutigerAero/.
