It is very popular among Japanese girls in their teens to late 30s..This style can be combined with pretty much any clothing but the most popular base fashions are Pop Kei and Fairy Kei. The outfits combine casual clothes with many layers in the form of multiple hair clips, bracelets, tulle skirts, stockings, leg warmers, and pins.
