Cyberprep is a term with a very similar meaning to postcyberpunk. The word is an amalgam of the prefix "cyber-", referring to cybernetics, and "preppy", reflecting its divergence from the punk elements of cyberpunk. A cyberprep world assumes that all the technological advancements of cyberpunk speculation have taken place but life is utopian rather than gritty and dangerous. Since society is largely leisure-driven, advanced body modifications are used for sports, pleasure and self-improvement..Cyberprep aesthetics take the visuals often seen in Cyberpunk, but present it in more of a utopian lens and talking about how it could potentially benefit society as opposed to presenting the potential ethical issues that could arise from technological advancement..While cyberpunk fashion is inspired by counter-cultural outfits, cyberprep clothing draws on New Wave, Y2K aesthetic and contemporary fashion. In synth clubs it's common for women to wear leather jackets and mini dresses that display their own brain patterns, while men wear Hussar jackets like Adam Ant. Walk down the street and you'll see women in shiny, chrome pantsuits and men wearing coats embedded with circuitry resembling artistic embroidery..Instead of Metal and Techno, cyberprep music is largely Synthpop, Synthrock and Synthwave like Missing Persons, Electric Youth, and Lazerhawk. Instead of gyrating to techno in a warehouse or BDSM club, cyberpreps dance to synthpop in a night club with hologram light shows..Empire of the sunGenki RocketsBoom boom satellitePerfume.Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom by Cory DoctorowManeki Neko by Bruce SterlingREEL by Sophie RenaudinO Human StarManna by Marshall BrainHalting State by Charles StrossPlastic MemoriesMemories of the AlhambraTwo Step by Warren EllisBionic by Suzanne WeynEpic by Conor KostickHieroglyph: Stories & Visions for a Better FutureA Certain Magical Index/A Certain Scientific Railgun by Kazuma KamachiPaprika by Satoshi KonSummer Wars by Mamoru Hosoda.External links to help get a better understanding of this aesthetic..Cyberprep/Post-Cyberpunk playlist by Luca Fagiani Runo.
