The indie aesthetic is based on individuality and independence. There are two camps of Indie, as the aesthetic underwent a modern resurgence in 2019-2020 labeled Indie Kid. Indie Kid is a bright, colorful style usually involving oversized jeans, large hoodies, and small shirts. This aesthetic rose to fame again through the app TikTok and centers around bright colors, 2000s-style fashion, and a skater lifestyle. This resurgence differs from the original Indie style which did not include such bright colors and was considered more "alternative" by today's standards. This style involved a variety of independent music genres, including shoegaze. This can also include the indie movie genre, as many movies in the genre add to the original indie aesthetic. .The Indie aesthetic was, in many ways, similar to the Pastel aesthetic, however, the color is paler and even less intense.  Another key difference between the two is while the Pastel aesthetic conveys a sense of innocence and sweetness, the Indie aesthetic conveys more of a darker, moodier tone. Photos in this aesthetic often have sad text overlaid to further communicate the mood. Indie blogs also often feature photos of ornate architectural spaces, snow-covered landscapes, and bruised skin. However, nowadays, there is also a specific way that videos and photos are edited. There are plenty of indie filters to choose from, but they all have some things in common. It's heavy on saturation and vibrance, and the contrast is lowered. The grain or noise effect is sometimes added as well. These videos and photos are most commonly edited on the Camera app on an iPhone..Pinterest boards are a good way to get inspiration related to an aesthetic.indie by thilde üßÉIndie fashion by Sydney OlsenIndie Inspiration by Pinterest UKindie, alt by Lucy GraceIndie by Claudioindie by celine: vintage ‚òÖ indie ‚òÖ grunge by holytrashvintage & indie by Seni Marouindie/emo aesthetic by evan.Old school Indie fashion was pretty vague and unassuming.
