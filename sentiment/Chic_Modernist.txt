Chic Modernist is a type of chic style that combines both the chic style with modern-day designs and styles. In the design world, chic means elegant, fashionable and trendy. Although the word has French origins, chic can be used to describe practically any style with a casual, understated look that is still hip, fresh, updated and modern. Chic can also be something unique, out of the ordinary or one-of-a-kind, such as a vintage item updated with modern colours and patterns. The style aims to reuse timeless pieces in a modern way..Chic Modernist styles are very similar to high fashion and French themes but are not strictly reliant on either. It is open to interpretation, but remains stylish and elegant. This may also refer to room styles..Chic Modernist fashion may also be referred to as "smart casual", meaning not super dressy but still looking nice and presentable. This can include pairing jeans with a blazer or heels, or a long skirt with a t-shirt. Often times clothing items remain solid colors rather than use patterns, otherwise, patterns are used very sparingly.
