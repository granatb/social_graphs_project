Please note that this page is currently under construction and incompleteAuroracore, also known as Ethereal Fantasy, is a genre of aesthetic consisting of ethereal fantasy visuals. It revolves around the concept of otherworldly magic and is heavily inspired by fantasy media created for young girls. This genre focuses on the concept of magic being tied to the soul and the artistic interpretation of that feeling. It is dream-like, surreal, magical, otherworldly, and pure. It is the brightest, most colorful light that luminates hope in a dark world.    .One of the key elements of this aesthetic is the unnatural emphasis or exaggeration of fantasy elements for the sole purpose of conveying the aesthetic. This aesthetic uses both color theory and artistic interpretation to convey the concept of magic being tied to one's soul or identity. It also has much to do with the restoration of things, people, or places covered in darkness and the expulsion of badness. ..One of the concepts that this aesthetic revolves around is the concept of an "ethereal form." These "forms" are brought to life when one discovers the power of an element about themselves that is a part of their soul identity. Examples of the demonstration of this aesthetic in media include:Starlight BrigadeThe scene paired with the bridge of Into the Unknown in Frozen IIThe scene paired with Show Yourself in Frozen IIThe Crystal Kingdom in My Little Pony: Friendship GamesTwilight Sparkle's Midnight Sparkle form in Equestria Girls: Friendship GamesMany of the scenes in Genshin ImpactMuch of the scenery of Steven UniverseRelated characters include:Glimmer from She-Ra and the Princesses of PowerPrincess Celestia from My Little Pony: Friendship is MagicPrincess Cadence from My Little Pony: Friendship is MagicPrincess Flurry Heart from My Little Pony: Friendship is MagicSilverstream from My Little Pony: Friendship is MagicSangonomia Kokomi from Genshin ImpactLight Fury from How to Train Your DragonSuicune from PokemonPrimarina from PokemonNevy Nervine from Ava's DemonWinter Wonder Neeko from League of LegendsElsa from FrozenPearl from Steven UniverseSisudatu from Raya and the Last DragonFarrah Goodfairy from Ever After HighGlimmerwing Dragon from DragonValeIden Dragon from DragonValeSwiftgrace Dragon from DragonValeReminiscence Dragon from DragonValeStrive from Starlight Brigade.Songs associated with Auroracore include:Into the Unknown by Idina MenzelForbidden Friendship by John PowellPisces by Xan GriffinStrange Clouds by ufo ufoElements by Lindsey StirlingLet Love Win by TheFatRatThird Date by John PowellShow Yourself by Idina MenzelNova by AhrixLibra by Xan GriffinThrenody by TheFatRatMirror Haus by Lindsey StirlingDark Sea by Christophe BeckMonody (A TheFatRat Orchestration) by Rush GarciaThe Hidden World by John Powell.
