Expressionism is a modernist movement, initially in poetry and painting, originating in Germany at the beginning of the 20th century. Expressionist artists have sought to express the meaning of emotional experience rather than physical reality.Its typical trait is to present the world solely from a subjective perspective, distorting it radically for emotional effect in order to evoke moods or ideas.The style originated principally in Germany and Austria. There were a number of groups of expressionist painters, including Der Blaue Reiter and Die Brücke.Expressionism developed as an avant-garde style before the First World War. It remained popular during the Weimar Republic,  particularly in Berlin. The style extended to a wide range of the arts, including expressionist architecture, painting, literature, theatre, dance, film and music.The term is sometimes suggestive of angst. In a historical sense, much older painters such as Matthias Grünewald and El Greco are sometimes termed expressionist, though the term is applied mainly to 20th-century works. The Expressionist emphasis on individual and subjective perspective has been characterized as a reaction to positivism and other artistic styles such as Naturalism and Impressionism...Among the poets associated with German Expressionism were:Jakob van HoddisGeorg TraklWalter RheinerGottfried BennGeorg HeymElse Lasker-SchülerErnst StadlerAugust StrammRainer Maria Rilke (1875–1926): The Notebooks of Malte Laurids Brigge (1910)Geo MilevT.
