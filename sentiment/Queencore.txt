Queencore is a more mature, regal variant of Princesscore and a subgenre of Royalcore.Queencore may consist of more adult-like themes, like politics and war, so it is assumed to be more heavy-handed than Princesscore. Inspiration can be drawn from matriarchal figures in hierarchy-centered shows and movies, especially those centered around kingdoms.Queencore aesthetics show through strength and guidance, skill and patience. Those who adopt a Queencore aesthetic may be seen as the leader of a group. They hold themselves to higher standards, as a way to show worthiness of their title and position. The Queencore aesthetic wouldn't be complete without confidence and displays of good leadership.For a darker approach, colors can be toned deeper, and inspiration can be drawn from evil queen characters. This aesthetic can be great inspiration for modern styles..Most visuals can be taken from castle exteriors, interiors, and grounds. This can include throne rooms, royal chambers, and gardens. Examples include:ThronesCrownsCapesOrnate staircasesPersonal librariesSceptersJewelryIntricate gardensRosesHorsesMarbleSwords and daggersVeilsBallgownsDark woodTall ceilings.Fashion may be taken directly from historical accounts or may be modernized. Real life examples can include historical figures like Queen Victoria for a more historical approach, or figures like Kate Middleton and Meghan Markle for more modern fashion. Fictional examples can include Queen Calanthe from The Witcher, Cersei Lannister from Game of Thrones, Mary, Queen of Scots from Reign, and The Countess from American Horror Story (for a more creative twist). Staples include intricate embroidery, beading, jewel and metal embellishments, darker or richer colors, and long sleeves.
