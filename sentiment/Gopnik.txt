Disclaimer: It has come to recent attention that some Slavic people are uncomfortable with non-Slavic people adopting this aesthetic. As such, it's a good idea to be respectful of Slavic culture if you plan to seriously adopt it into your life. If you are Slavic, feel free to critically discuss Gopnik in the comments (but do be civil aswell!). Gopnik is a fashion aesthetic that involves wearing clothing of the Gopnik, a member of a subculture in Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and other former Soviet republics. Since the fashion was established after the fall of the USSR, the Gopnik style was influenced by lower-income citizens at the time. .A famous staple of the Gopnik style is that of Adidas-branded clothing.

Hardbass is an electronics genre that utilizes bass, as it's name suggest. This includes powerful kick drums and heavy synthesizer work. Since it's region is that of Russia and other Slavic countries, the lyrics will often be in Russian or of similar languages. Most famous of the existing hardbass songs include "Cheeki Breeki" and "Tri Poloski (Three Stripes)."Related artists and tracks:GSPDHard Bass SchoolXS ProjectRussian Village BoysLittle BigORGONITE - ADIBASSHard Bass School - Gop FMRussian Village Boys & Mr. Polska - AdidasCMH x GSPD x RUSSIAN VILLAGE BOYS - ANTI GIRLGSPD feat.
