Heistcore is associated with thieves and heists, the elaborate thefts of data, money, art, jewels, and historical documents. Heistcore aesthetics can be found in espionage, crime, and detective media. Because of the value of the stolen goods, heists are considered more high class than cons in general. The title Gentleman Thief is sometimes applied to males who participate in heists, especially in media set during the Golden Age of Detective Fiction. The female equivalent is the Cat Burglar..In fiction, heists are a major part of the caper genre. Thieves and heists appear in literature as far back as medieval times, with the creation of the Robin Hood character in English folklore. Modern Heistcore was revived in the 1920s due to the discovery of King Tut's tomb and the resulting craze for all things Egyptian. European grave robbers looted Egyptian tombs and trafficked artifacts to Europe. Many of these artifacts were purchased by wealthy aristocrats and eventually ended up in museums, especially The British Museum.Modern fiction centered around heists often questions the legitimacy of ownership. Thieves orchestrate heists of Greek, Egyptian, and Middle Eastern artwork from European museums or the private collections of corrupt politicians in order to return the artwork to its rightful owners.In real life, the so-called Monuments Men, were responsible for retrieving artwork stolen by the Nazis during World War Two, and returning it to the surviving descendants of the Jewish people from which it was stolen..Heistcore has a dark, deep, and metallic color palette. Colors include black, tan, cream, gold, silver, and jewel tones like deep red, blue, and green. The aesthetic of wealth, both the nouveau riche and Old Money, appears in Heistcore due to the wealthy often being the mark, or victim of the heist in question.gold bars, coins, and statuespaper money in high denominationschampagne and champagne glassesLouboutin heelsfur coatsbold makeup like winged eyeliner and red lipstickdiamondsbrightly colored jewels like rubies, sapphires, and emeraldsbank vaults with elaborate locking mechanismsrubber masks with the faces of American presidents or celebritiesantique letters, books, and mapsoil paintings in gold framesmarble statuesclocks and watchesexotic pets like peacocks, sharks, and alligatorsVespa scooters.The catsuit is a fashion piece which comes directly from Heistcore. It is a full body, skintight garment, usually made of leather or faux leather, with a zipper that runs from the neckline to the waist area. It is rarely worn by men..A key element of a heist is gaining access to a secure area. For this to work, disguises are often employed.maids, cleaners, and repairmennuns, priests, and monksart expertswealthy patrons and customerselderly peoplelaw enforcement such as police and security guardsball gowns and expensive suits appropriate for a black tie event.Bag Borrow or StealMetal Masters Co.Rent the Runway.AntiquesDiamond shaped glass paperweightsFaberge eggMarble statuesOil paintingsPersian rugsRed velvet curtainsSecurity camerasWall safesWhiskey decanters and glasses.Most museum gift shops sell poster prints of artworks in their collection. In National Treasure, this is played for laughs when the real Declaration of Independence is mistaken for a replica Ben Gates is stealing from the shop. A similar incident happens in the film Bean. The title character accidentally ruins the original painting of Whistler's Mother and replaces it with a poster from the museum gift shop. Some shops also sell replicas of statues, although they are often small scale replicas of much larger pieces.British Museum shopFine Arts AmericaGuggenheim Museum StoreThe LACMA StoreLouvre Online StoreMet Museum Online StoreMoMA Design StoreSFMOMA Museum StoreTate Online ShopWhitney Shop.Theft is illegal, but there are many useful and interesting skills that thieves have which ordinary people can do for fun.Attending art auctionsCoin collectingGymnasticsLearning self-defenseLock picking on vintage locks from antique shopsPlaying pokerVisiting museumsThere are also some activities that feel like theft or even heists because society has conditioned us to behave in certain ways.Asking for a raiseCouponingDonating to RIP Medical Debt - you’ll feel like Robin Hood, "robbing from the rich and giving to those in need"GeocachingSearching for Unclaimed Money/Property/InheritanceTaking free samples..Chasing Vermeer by Blue BalliettHeist Society series by Ally Carter.Heist board gameMaster Thief card gameMaster Pieces: The Curator's Game by Thomas HovingArt Mysteries series by Anna Nilsen.21 (2008)American Animals (2018) American Hustle (2013)Ant-Man (2015)Baby Driver (2017)Entrapment (1999)Focus (2015)Gambit (2012)Heat (1995)How to Steal a Million (1966)Jack of Diamonds (1967)Kajillionaire (2020)Locked Down (2021)Logan Lucky (2017)National Treasure (2004) and National Treasure: Book of Secrets (2007)Now You See Me (2013)Ocean’s moviesRed Notice (2021)The Art of the Steal (2013)The Bank Job (2008)The Bling Ring (2013)The Brothers Bloom (2008)The Goldfinch (2019)The Great Train Robbery (1979)The Italian Job (1969)The Italian Job (2003)The Ladykillers (2004)The Maiden Heist (2009)The Misfits (2021)The Saint (1997)The Saint (2017)The Sting (1973)The Thomas Crown Affair (1968)The Thomas Crown Affair (1999)Widows (2018).Blood and Treasure (2019-)Leverage (2008-2012)Lupin (2021-)Lupin III (anime franchise with no relation to the above)Money Heist (2017-)The Blacklist (2013-)White Collar (2009-2014)Wired (2008).Kane & Lynch: Dead Men (2007)Rhythm Thief & the Emperor's Treasure (2012)Payday: The Heist (2011)Payday 2 (2013)Persona 5 (2016).Arsène LupinLupin IIICarmen SandiegoCatwomanSimon Templar..The robbery of the Mona Lisa.The Amber Room at Catherine Palace in Tsarskoye Selo, Russia, was dismantled by the Nazis and taken to be displayed at Königsberg Castle in 1941.
