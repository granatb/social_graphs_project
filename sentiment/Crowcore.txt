Crowcore is primarily derived from Goblincore and Cottagecore. This aesthetic focuses mainly on nature, environmentalism, crows and collecting (usually shiny) objects from nature and urban environments. Crowcore is generally darker than either of its initial inspirations.  Crowcore is sometimes used as an alternative to Goblincore, which has been criticized as anti-Semitic, but which shares the value of collecting small, lost, broken, thrown away, or conventionally trivial objects, and nature visuals.  There is significant Tumblr cross-tagging between Crowcore, Gremlincore, Cottagecore, and various other related aesthetics.   .Some of these can include:Old coinsFeathersTiny glittery pebbles/stonesBones/Animal skullsRusty bottle capsTiny sculptures (usually of birds or other forest friends)Vintage brooches/locketsSeaglassItems with crows present on themAgatesShiny sharp things like swords, knives, or daggers.Activities include (but are not limited to):SewingDressmakingCollectingWading in creeks looking for frogs or salamandersOrganize your collections (putting them in pretty containers)ReadingStudyingMaking charcoal drawingsExploringSpending time with friendsPlaying D&D.A Wrinkle in Time by Madeline Lâ€™EngleAnd Then There Were None by Agatha Christie  	 	 	 		 			 		 		 		 	 .DaughterLord Huron.Crowcore fashion is similar to Cottagegore and Goblincore.
