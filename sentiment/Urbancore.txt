Urbancore is an aesthetic based on imagery of urban cities and street life. Urbancore is associated to real-life, modern-day society and almost always is based in recent decades.  It can revolve around city streets, graffiti, skate parks at night, and picnics. Similar to High School Dream, this aesthetic embodies a youthful and somewhat rebellious spirit of a teen living in a nostalgic time. .As expected, Urbancore aesthetics focus heavily on the city and city life.vandalismgraffitiindustrial architecturerooftops, alleyways, spaces between buildingstrain stationsworn-down/empty buildingsskyscrapersconcretestreet fixtures, such as benches, street lamps, road signsurban explorationunpopulated buildings such as warehousesbarren concrete stairwellsdirty areasgarbage clutterdumpstersconcrete rubble.Urbancore fashion draws heavily from Skater, Art Hoe, Hip-Hop and Nostalgiacore fashion, since this aesthetic is fairly active, a lot of the clothing is fashionable and breathable.  A very particular kind of Urbancore fashion, Streetwear, is a style of casual clothing which became global in the 1990s. It grew from Californian surf and skate culture to encompass elements of sportswear, hip hop, punk and Japanese street fashion and continued to grow and evolve from there.  This style can also be closely related to the Baddie aesthetic, which gravitates to brands like Nike, Jordan, and Louis Vuttion.
