Shanzhai is an aesthetic that involves contemporary use usually encompasses counterfeit, imitation, or parody products and events and the subculture surrounding them..Most Shanzhai visuals come out of, no surprise, China, as they have very, very loose copyright laws, so often types they will take on the appearance of popular Western brands with some minor changes to not only convince locals that it's just as good as the Western brands, but also potentially give Western tourists something familiar to give them a little taste of home..Shanzhai fashion consists of bootleg versions of popular luxury fashion brands (Nike, Gucci, Hermes, Louis Vuitton, Cartier).  If one wants to go for that Boujee or Hypebeast look, but don't exactly have the budget for the name brand stuff, the Shanzhai aesthetic might be a nice alternative, especially as the Shanzhai variants becomes more and more indistinguishable from the genuine article..
