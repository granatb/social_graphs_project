Cryptidcore is traditionally associated with cryptozoology, or the study of creatures from urban legends and folklore, and the glorification and idolization of cryptids, conspiracies, and all-around mystery. Cryptidcore is also, generally vintage, and takes visual inspiration, especially with regards to fashion, from the 1970s - 90s. Another aspect of cryptidcore is the romanticization of cryptids. Phrases like "Mothman is real, I'm married to him" are common in cryptidcore circles..This section is under constructionDuring the mid-2010s, it was common for fandoms to create moodboards that encapsulate the aesthetic of the work or certain characters. Scooby-Doo (1969), Twin Peaks (1990), The X-Files (1993), Welcome to Night Vale (2012), Gravity Falls (2012), and Buzzfeed Unsolved (2016) are some exemplary fandoms that created these moodboards independently of the aesthetic tag. What makes these works appealing to the Cryptidcore aesthetic is explained in the media section below.The term "Cryptidcore" first emerged from tumblr user on-a-crescendo in 2014, where they give a list of visuals, such as "kitschy t shirts and keychains from souvenir shops depicting the local urban legends and monsters," "tin foil hats," and "muffled x files, gravity falls, and twilight zone theme songs playing in the distance." This gained popularity, and the tag was born. As the text post was passed around and fans of different media made moodboards, the fans of Cryptidcore started to make aesthetic posts outside the context of fandom. Many Cryptidcore elements also originated from the Regional Gothic trend on tumblr in 2015. Much of the trend was focused on elements of mystery, unreality, and the uncanny valley. Images such as deer in darkness, forests, diners, etc. in the Regional Gothic trend were popular, and have clear crossover with Cryptidcore. .Dark forestsAbandoned buildingsPolaroid camerasKitschy t-shirtsKey chainsGlow-in-the-dark iconographyAlien imagerySupernatural-themed tourist trapsOuija boardsTin foil hatsOld alien or supernatural moviesVHS tapesPocket knivesOld newspapers of cryptid sightingsCryptozoology field diaries.Cryptidcore includes fashion that is casual, vintage, and retro style.
