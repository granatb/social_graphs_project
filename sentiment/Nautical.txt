Nautical is an aesthetic centered around sailing and living near the sea. .Nautical visuals mostly involve images of life on the sea, on a boat, or even from the shore living in a lighthouse (which differentiates it from a Tropical aesthetic, which tends to have more of a focus on warmer beaches as opposed to the rocky coasts often associated with Lighthouse imagery). This aesthetic also includes or relates to a ship tied up to the dock.  This aesthetic gives the feeling of being at sea or on the ocean or relaxing on a boat or a yacht. Elements that can be included in the Nautical aesthetic include:The ocean and beachBoatingSalty airTurtlesDolphinsSeagullsDocks and boardwalksLighthousesBeach houses.The fashion aesthetic often involves a navy jacket with brass buttons, a crisp white sailor's uniform, a sou'wester hat, and yellow slicker, or a fisherman's sweater. Historic traditions in nautical dress continue to influence modern nautical apparel. When it comes to nautical dressing, blues, stripes, and sweaters are staples for a reason. Their look reflects the essence of what it should look and feel like to be on the sea.  A lot of Resort wear can also be included in Nautical fashion.
