This page will undergo a revamp and analyze the origins, misinterpretations, and whether or not there is an "essence" of Larme. This will include interviews and citations. LARME magazine is a Japanese magazine founded in 2012 and described as a "sweet and cute girl's fashion picture book." by Haruna Nakagoori. The target audience was cultured young women from the ages of 18-25, who would read and go to museums. A unique feature of the magazine is its editing style, with multiple props and illustrations being used to decorate the pages. The fashion magazine has a distinctly feminine style that balances kawaii and sexy elements, with multiple vintage-inspired pieces and interesting textures. In the West, the style is referred as "larme kei," but that name is not recognized in Japan, and is instead referred to as "girly fashion" or by simply "LARME fashion." .The scrapbook-style editing of the magazine, along with its stylized backgrounds, allows the fashion magazine to enhance its aesthetic beyond fashion.
