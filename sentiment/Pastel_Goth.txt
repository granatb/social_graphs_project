Pastel Goth (not to be confused with Gurokawa or Nu-Goth) is a fashion that first emerged from groups on VK.com and later spread to Tumblr in the early 2010. It is a result of mixing goth or grunge with the sweet pastel elements of the kawaii aesthetic, but also a touch of bohemian chic. It also spread in popularity in Japan for a brief period thanks to the DJ Juria Nakagawa who's style has always been highly influenced by what is popular on Tumblr.        .Pastel skies and galaxiesGradient filtersInverted crossesKawaii offensive textMean Girls quotesDripping things (like dripping fonts, dripping leggings, and others)Eyeball bowsSkeletons and bonesBatsThe yin yang symbolCrystalsEdits of Disney characters wearing the fashion. 	 	 	 			   	 	 		 		 			✝✜✙ Pastel Goth Makeup Tutorial ✙✜✝｜可愛いパステルゴス♡メイク 		 		 			Pastel Goth Makeup 		 	 Pastel Goth clothing and accessories are often handmade and sold by indie brands, emphasizing individuality and creativity.Pastel or dip-dye hairFlower crownsStudded hairbandsRound sunglassesUnusual color lipstickChunky cross necklacesPeter pan collarsDyed denim vestsOversize sweaters or teesLeather gartersTattoo print tightsLace ankle socksCreepers (the shoes)Platform boots.Many pastel goths listen to Melanie Martinez and other artists with a babyish theme.The pastel character of the story {A simple playlist} Spotify playlist by Alex WheelerPastel goth (lavender theme) spotify playlist by miraya ☁️Pastel goth radio Spotify playlist by 💖🌸Kitty🧚‍♀️✨👛💀💖Pastel Goth💖💀 Spotify playlist by Kylie UnderwoodMy Vibes 🌸⚡️🖤 Spotify playlist by yasemin.ozutPastel goth Spotify playlist by GhostyPastel Goth Spotify playlist by Demi GrayPastel Goth † Spotify playlist by imkimbogPastel Goth Feels Spotify playlist by Larissa WeathersThe Birthday Massacre (Band) on Bandcamp..DevilishHello CavitiesHolley Tea TimeIn Control ClothingKreepsville666MonomaniaNewBreedGirlListenFlavorMerbunnyBabyDaymare.
