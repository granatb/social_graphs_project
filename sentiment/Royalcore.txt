Royalcore is a term referring to a group of aesthetics based on the visuals of West European royalty, ranging from Arthurian times (5th and 6th centuries) to the Belle Époque period (late 19th century). Royalcore revolves around refinement and classic western standards of behavior. Intelligence, morality, skill, and elegance are base qualities that give more meaning to the look. Visually, this aesthetic focuses on castle structure and the surrounding grounds, including knight training arenas and gardens.  Sets of laws called sumptuary laws were placed to differentiate the types of fabrics, colors, and types of clothes for social classes. Royal wear consisted of many layers made from high-quality fabrics like silk, velvet, taffeta, wool and fur. Colors were also reserved for royalty, as vibrant colors like purple and gold could only be affordable to those of high status.   Royalcore, as of now, mainly focuses on visual characteristics and contexts of historical European monarchies. This context is awaiting further extension to include other culturally significant aspects of royalty.
