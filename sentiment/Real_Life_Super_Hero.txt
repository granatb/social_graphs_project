Real Life Super Hero (often shortened to RLSH) movement is an aesthetic that involves dressing up like comic book character and generally engage in good deeds, where it can range from simple things like visiting sick children in a hospital to simple neighborhood watches to more controversial actions like actual vigilantism which is dangerous.  The aesthetic has a small relation to Kidcore, in the sense that it ties into a child-like notion of justice and wanting to do right. .Oftentimes, the aesthetic will put out promotional material for their superhero endeavors that invoke the aesthetics of a comic book itself.  While generally, members of the Real Life Super Hero aesthetic put on the costume and just go out and be Good Samaritans, there have been members of the movement who actually got trained in the martial arts to actually fight crime, which they often get criticized for due to it being viewed as a form of vigilantism; the most infamous example of this being Phoenix Jones, who was known to get incredibly physical with criminals he was busting before he, himself, turned out to be a criminal in his own right after his recent arrest due to being caught with possession of cocaine with intent to sell; becoming the very thing he used to fight against..SpandexMasksTactical gear (often painted up in bright colours)CapesTrench-coatsFedoras or any other sort of comic book charactersMasks in particular are necessary to protect the civilian identities in case they have a run-in with the law or with particularly violent criminals..
