The Western aesthetic (also known as the Wild West) is a popular genre inspired by the lives of early settlers of the American Frontier. The Western aesthetic entails themes of self-reliance, solitude, and wildness. Western folklore often includes tales of lone vigilantes travelling the American Frontier on horseback, more times than not armed with a six-shooter revolver or a rifle and prepared to dole out justice. Visually, the Western aesthetic shares many similarities to that of Country, but places an emhasis on imagery of the historical Wild West, as well as the motifs of vigilantism and adventure commonly depicted in popular Western films. While the Country aesthetic romanticizes the life of family, farming, and living in the countryside, Western focuses more on the idea of the wilderness, specifically the desert and prairie, as well as wandering town to lawless town dotted accross the American Frontier.  A Space Western, alternatively called Space Cowboy, is a subgenre of the Western aesthetic that applies the themes of the American Frontier to outer space, or the "Final Frontier." This theme has been explored in different media such as the anime Cowboy Bebop (1998) and film John Carter (2012).Another subgenre of the Wild West is the Weird West, which mixes the Western style with horror or mystery. Quentin Tarantino's 2015 film The Hateful Eight combines the Western film genre with Murder Mystery.. 	 	 	 		 			 		 		 		 			"Riding off into the sunset" 		 	 The Western look emerged at the time of American expansion westward from the settlers who founded the first townships. Old West attire was commonly handmade and included warm earth tones and organic materials. The outfits and style of American cowboys were inspired by Mexican Vaqueros whom taught the cowboys many of their techniques for cow herding. Wide-brimmed hats to protect from the scorching desert sun and spurs crucial for horse riding were essential for all travelling frontiersmen and women. Sunsets and tumbleweeds are iconic symbols of the Western setting. The Western aesthetic includes barren deserts, praries, and mountains that are scattered across the American Frontier. The outposts and small towns that inhabited the West were marked by wooden buildings, saloons, churches, and other small developments.  Crime was extremely rife in the Old West and is a major theme of the Western aesthetic. Rogue gangs of armed outlaws ran wild in the Old West, such as Butch Cassidy's Wild Bunch or The Cochise County Cowboys, whom may have been responsible for connecting the term "Cowboy" to mean "Outlaw." The gangs of the Wild West inspired much of the Western media that followed after the fall of the American Frontier.  	 	 	 		 			 		 		 		 	 .Muted tones and earth colorsCowboy hats and bootsHorsesCattle and bisonCacti and other desert floraTumbleweedsSunsetsLeatherGuns - notably six-shooters, rifles, and shotgunsCigars and cigarillosAlcoholStagecoaches and covered wagonsOld-fashioned trains.Western fashion typically includes organic fabrics and warm tones.
