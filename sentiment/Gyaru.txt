Gyaru (ギャル) is one of the oldest Japanese fashions that still exists today. Despite being mostly known for its variant that peaked in the 1990s, it already existed previously in different forms since its name was first coined in 1968. At the height of its popularity, it was not rare to see celebrities spotting this style. The tanned skin, big hair, and rebellious outfits went highly against the traditional Japanese beauty standards.
