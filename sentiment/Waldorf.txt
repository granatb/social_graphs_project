Waldorf is a teaching style created by Rudolph Steiner in 1919. However, as the education movement has grown, it has also established itself as its own aesthetic. The Aesthetic is very much related to cottagecore but without the French Impressionist inspirations. Unlike the educational style, the aesthetic of Waldorf is for all ages and nearly universal.  	 	 	 		 			 		 		 		 			A Waldorf style watercolor piece. Notice the colors and brush stroke style. Abstraction is very common in this aesthetic 		 	 Waldorf is the secular term for the aesthetic, however many schools and people who follow Waldorf methods follow Wicca, hence the secondary name, Light Wicca. Waldorf is very similar to a more colorful, and childish Wicca aesthetic and is the primary decorative style of choice for many Wiccans/Witches, especially those with children..Waldorf as a style is a minimalist movement in the style of forestcore, fairycore, or cottagecore. But a lot of the visuals can differ strongly, although some similarities overlap.Pastel colored walls; usually green, pink, or yellow.light colored natural wood furnitureCrafts made by unskilled hands (Pieces with visible mistakes you can't buy at stores, but are proud of because you made)Wooden objects that still look like logs or sticks.Minimal decoration. Everything in the room has a use, even if it's for fun. Things that have a use can have decoration (i.e. a plant holder with a nice design on it or a sweater with a fair isle pattern). Minimalist but not cold and sterile. The environment should foster creativity.Everything that's used is hand made if possible. No cheap plastic objects or even antiques.Jewel tones and rainbows are used in moderation, but have their place.Colorful bookshelvessalt lamps, not for health purposes, just because they look nice.Chalk boardsFake stained glassHandmade dream catchers made of things you found in the forestInteriors should kind of look like how you imagine a fairy house..QuiltsEverything is embroidered, knitted, crocheted, or woodworkedGardens and gardeningAn Eco-Friendly lifestyleMushroomsFantasy elements like fairies, witches, and most notably, gnomes.No modernness.

Clothing is not usually vintage, it can be but it's not common.

Its pedagogy strives to develop pupils' intellectual, artistic, and practical skills in an integrated and holistic manner. The cultivation of pupils' imagination and creativity is a central focus.Individual teachers and schools have a great deal of autonomy in determining curriculum content, teaching methodology, and governance. Qualitative assessments of student work are integrated into the daily life of the classroom, with quantitative testing playing a minimal role and standardized testing usually limited to what is required to enter post-secondary education..
