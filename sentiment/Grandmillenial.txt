"Ranging in age from mid-20s to late-30s, Grandmillennials have an affinity for design trends considered by mainstream culture to be "stuffy" or "outdated"—Laura Ashley prints, ruffles, embroidered linens. Unlike that of the late-aughts hipster, their taste for the antiquated isn’t ironic; it’s less twee than timeless. And although there’s a good bit of shared DNA with prep culture, the two terms aren’t entirely interchangeable; the grandmillennial is less Lilly Pulitzer, more faded D. Porthault." - House Beautiful, September 4, 2019.The term Grandmillenial was coined by Emma Bazilian in 2019 for an article in House Beautiful.."The essence of the Grandmillennial style involves a young (ish) person taking ownership of granny’s needlepoint pillows and tasseled lampshades and making them share space with their existing mid-century modern/Scandinavian/farmhouse decor........ chintzy upholstery on chairs and couches, punchy flora and fauna patterns on window treatments and wallpaper, and block-printed table linen. There are needlepoint cushion covers (many now sport slogans instead of the standard floral motifs), blue and white china, lampshades in wicker, and skirts and tassels on pretty much everything. An obsession with flower frogs and roses of all colors and varieties rounds up this trend." - Food52, December 12, 2019.BowoodHollyhockToiles du JouyBird & ThistleLes TouchesDollyRoses/Floral.“Every grandmillennial takes to this trend differently,..... But across the board, millennials are tossing their skinny jeans and leggings for a ladylike look, choosing modest styles, vintage-inspired pieces and desiring a more conscious wardrobe that impacts the environment less.” - Sammy Davis, Today, March 11, 2020Crochet SweatersVintage (1910s-1960s) AttireHeirloom JewelryBroochesGlasses ChainsVintage Clip-on EarringsLocketsMonograms.Needle Point PillowsPatterned WallpaperFine ChinaWicker FurnitureAntique (?-1970s) FurnitureLampshadesRufflesBed CanopiesQuiltsPorcelainHeirloom PaintingsTchotchkesMixing Prints.LycetteClaire MurrayAmy Berry HomeLaura AshleyD.
