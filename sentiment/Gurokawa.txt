Gurokawa (グロカワ), also known as Creepy Cute in the west, describes a fashion and aesthetic trend that combines grotesque elements with kawaii. It is often confused with the Yami Kawaii trend, which revolves around cute medical and dark themes, but Gurokawa has more of a horror theme to it and is rarely in pastels. .Cute things just being cute has been common in Japan, so when there's something off about the cuteness, it makes it more interesting. Gurokawa is appealing because up until its creation many people haven't really seen a world where cute things are cruel. Bloodstains, dripping blood, bats, ghosts, and all kinds of monsters are a common visual theme.    .Gloomy bear is a cute-looking but violent pink bear that eats humans. The character was created by illustrator Mori Chack. Gloomy is a little over 6 feet tall and weighs as much as 2,000 pomegranates. Owned by human Pitty, he’s well trained for the most part, but he can never remember that he’s not supposed to attack humans. Still, a pet owner must take ultimate responsibility for his pets. Recalling warm memories of Gloomy as a cute cub, Pitty tries to lead a life of peaceful co-existence with his pet bear..Eyeballs as motifs and accessories are popular within the gurokawa fashion and other similar fashions such as decora.
