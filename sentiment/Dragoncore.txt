Dragoncore is an aesthetic that rose to relevance together with other more mythical and nature-related aesthetics, during the 2010s. It is seen as an direct foil to Goblincore and Crowcore due to its values of appreciating and collecting shiny, beautiful trinkets like jewels, coins and various gemstones, but it can also be collecting things of sentimental value to the user. The difference to the other two aesthetics lies in the hoard. Where goblins collect ugly and crows collect trivial things, a dragon collects "worthy" treasures.  .Due to its relatively recent creation, it hasn't yet properly developed the true specific values of what being Dragoncore is, commonly overlapping with other aesthetics, but this can also been seen as a good thing, as there aren't a lot of rules to go by, allowing the people of this aesthetic to express themselves however they like. This is part of why Dragoncore is a favorite of the otherkin, therian and LGBTQIA+ communities, with the themes of not applying to usual gender labels.It seems to have generally a respect of nature and its beauty, and a more elegant, refined well-kept vibe, compared to the messy aesthetic of its counterpart, more dim and darker lighting as well, and an appreciation of dragonic artwork and media of all sorts.Dragons are connected to decadence, oppulence and elegance. Showing of your collection (be it the hoard of knowledge or the one of materialistic treasures) without it being distatefull. .Note: as put in the section above, Dragoncore doesnâ€™t really have any specific values as of now. The values of Dragoncore are connected to the traits and personalities that are usually attributed to dragons in legends and modern media.IntelligenceWisdomIndependenceStrengthFreedomMaterialismSelfcareAmbition.Dragonology booksDragon's BaitDragonsdale and its sequel Riding the StormDragon RiderDragonriders of Pern seriesDragon Slippers seriesElmer and the DragonEnchanted Forest ChroniclesEragon seriesGame of ThronesHis Majesty's Dragon seriesHow to Train Your Dragon booksLord of the Rings trilogyMy Fathers DragonPit Dragon TrilogySeraphina seriesThe HobbitWings of Fire seriesWings of Fire graphic novelsThe Last Dragon Chronicles seriesHow To Become a Dragon.How To Train Your DragonLord of the RingsThe HobbitGame of Thrones.Starting a new collectionCollecting treasure you find (coins, pins, etc.)Washing and cleaning the treasures you have in your hoardOrganizing previous collectionsAdmiring your treasuresCleaning your living spaceSpending time with and taking care of your petsStudyingProtecting and taking care of the other people in your flock of dragonsTaking time by yourself to reflect on your morals, beliefs and life decisionsFor religious people: spending time practicing your religionPursuing your hobbiesDoing what you enjoyDoing a Random act of kindnessReading dragon related books or watching dragon related moviesDrawing dragons, sculpting dragons or creating dragons out of other miscellaneous things.Fashion can be separeted into two different takes on dragoncore. One is centered around cosplaying and larping, the second idea speculates about the choices of a dragon in modern (in perspective of a dragon, for us oldfashioned) fashion. Both would make use of large amounts of jewellry.  .Capes, wings, cloaks, fake tails, fake fangs, etc.Black nail polish to represent talons if you really want to look every bit of a dragon as you canEyelinerDragon accessories like bracelets with wings on them, earrings with dragons on them, etc.Combat boots.well-cut suits and waistcoats, tailor made,exotic and excentric materialsBrogue/Full Brogue Shoespocket watches, wristwatchesrings and earrings, bracelets (regardless of gender)Rubies and garnetsGold, black and red/burgundyNote: It may be that some things I list may seem like odd clothing choices to you, I simply tried to brainstorm based off of dragon pictures I found.
