Kidcore is an aesthetic that centers around bright colors, nostalgia for icons from the 90s, and kid themes. While its origins can be traced back to the 1990s/80s, it appears the aesthetic is a nostalgia-based creation of the 2010s..Common motifs in Kidcore visuals are bright colors frequently used on children's toys, most frequently highly saturated versions of the traditional primary colors (red, yellow, and blue), playgrounds, stuffed animals such as Beanie Babies and TY, robot pets like Furbies, Lisa Frank artwork, rainbows, and other kid themes. Other common themes involved in Kidcore include:Bedtime storiesBooksColorful bookshelvesWatercolors and detailed lineworkRabbits and miceAlphabet blocksGames CupboardBalloons.Kidcore fashion is typically colorful and highly saturated, and predominantly utilizes the traditional primary colors, but it does sometimes include neutrals, secondary colors and pastels.
