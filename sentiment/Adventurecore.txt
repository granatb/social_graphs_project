Adventurecore involves adventure, the great unknown, and exploration. The main theme and philosophy are encouraging curiosity and having a yearning to see it all. The original creator, Tumblr user advenchurre (now deactivated) has stated "It's about the idea of navigating the world like you're a protag about to set off on a big cross-country journey. Even if you live in the suburbs".It originated on Tumblr, and was created on July 9th, 2019, but has since then branched out into different social media platforms such as Instagram and TikTok..Since Adventurecore is such a broad aesthetic the standards of fashion are flexible and can be difficult to discern from contemporary fashion. Here it has been sorted into three distinct categories..Associated with daily life, Stylistic Adventurecore is more based on presentation than practical activities.Beanies/beatnik capsCloaks, ponchos, shawls, scarfsDenim/corduroy jackets and pantsDocs, sneakers, tennis shoesLong coats; trench coatsSatchelsTrousersTurtlenecks.Practical Adventurecore is more suited for camping, hiking, and outdoor travel, with specialised clothing and equipment to help navigate through the elements.Beanies or sun hatsCombat or hiking bootsExtraneous equipment such as compasses or flashlightsFingerless glovesHiking backpacksRain jacketsSki jackets.Both practical and stylish!
