Suburban Gothic is an aesthetic based around feelings of alienation and the uncanny in suburban neighborhoods. Common motifs include coming-of-age, familial/generational trauma, facades, and the shallowness of capitalistic culture. The motifs and photographs are American-centric, with parodies and dark interpretations of the 1950s nuclear family and 1980s economic boom. There is a heavy emphasis on the use of Liminal Space, supernatural beings, and tropes typically found in suburban culture, such as housewives and cheerleaders. Those characters and locations tend to have a dark secret, such as drug addiction or infidelity to emphasize the darker nature of the restrictiveness of social norms.  While sharing similar traits with Southern Gothic and Midwest Gothic, there is no specific region or nation that appears prominently in suburban gothic. The aesthetic has its origins in literature, film, and television, but later gained a visual aesthetic and more examples through short bullet-pointed lists with the regional gothic trend on Tumblr in the mid-2010s..Animals that evoke the supernatural, such as black dogs or deerBeings/items that seem misplaced in the settingConvenience storesDrug addictionEmpty dinersFogGhosts, especially sheetedGraffitiGrocery storesLaundromatsLights that are an unusual color, such as red or blueMallsPlaygroundsRoads and highwaysRun-down carsStreet lampsSuburban neighborhoods at nightTraumacore style edits of depressing messages layered over imagesTechnology from the 60s-80s, such as box TVs and telephones.For more, see the TVTropes page. .White Noise by Don DeLillioSuch a Quiet Place by Megan Miranda .American Beauty (1999)Beetlejuice (1988)Blue Velvet (1986)Carrie (1976)Edward Scissorhands (1990)Gone Girl (2014)Heathers (1988)Jennifer's Body (2009)Super Dark Times (2017)The Burbs (1989)The Nightmare on Elm Street (1984)The Stepford Wives (1975)The Virgin Suicides (1999).Welcome to Nightvale.Dead to Me (2019-)Pretty Little Liars (2010-2017)Sharp Objects (2018)Stranger Things (2016-)The Addams Family (1964-1966)The Twilight Zone (specifically episodes centering around suburbia, such as "The Monsters are Due on Maple Street")Twin Peaks (1990-1991)Why Women Kill (2019-)..Inbred by Ethel CainThe Suburbs by Arcade FireNeon Bible by Arcade FirePure Heroine by LordeThe Normal Album by Will WoodPunisher by Phoebe BridgersPlease by Pet Shop Boys.my life as a dark indie coming of age filmStrangerhoodsuburban gothicsuburban hazeamerican suburbia but something isn't quite right.
