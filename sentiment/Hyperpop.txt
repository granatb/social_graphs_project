Hyperpop is a genre of music that combines both EDM and traditional pop. The genre puts an extreme emphasis on cuteness, femininity and intoxication. This is achieved by extreme pitching and warping of both the bass and rhythm, as well as upbeat, bubbly synths. The genre stems mainly from club and nightcore, and consists of high levels of surrealism and confusion..The genre of hyperpop was born out of EDM and traditional pop, and has influences from electroclash and witch house. Other genres of music that are incorporated into hyperpop include dubstep, chiptune and cloud rap. It is also seen as similar to nu-rave. Another heavy influence on the genre is electroclash, which is a very similar genre which died out in the 2000s.In 2019, Spotify listed an official hyperpop playlist, which further publicised the genre. This playlist consisted of 100 Gecs, Slayyyter, Gupi, Caroline Polachek, Hannah Diamond, and Kim Petras..For most Hyperpop art the layout is extremely crowded (an exception would be 100gecs' 1000gecs album). It is a combination of diverse art styles, so I will be sticking with some of the common themes. Most of the images, esepecially cover art from songs produced and sung by individuals who are female have heavy inspiration from other aesthetics such as Baddie, Y2K, and Slimepunk to a lesser extent...Hyperpop fashion is akin to Y2K Baddie (see Baddie), with wilder element such as vibrant makeup with sparkles, extremely long lashes and glittery, shiny or glossy clothing. Long or well kept hair is seen a key to express yourself and dyed hair is common, as well as long acrylic nails. Bright colors are key!..100gecsTalking headunderscoresCharli XCXGrimesGFOTYKero Kero BonitoPc music andTuneShawn WasabiCosmicosmoGlow WurmVALENTINEMachine GirlAlice Longyu GaoHannah DiamondSlayyyterTikTok Danielglaiveericdoaaldnoaf1SEBiiDanny L HarleLARSDorian ElectraSOPHIEThe duo of trust and unityHANALIZSerena SmithBoo From MArioElyOttoAyesha EroticaThat KidSimple SimonThe raving gangNipaYammyTurtles and catsthe kangarooooTusherToffanFood houseGraveyardguy...and many more! feel free to explore the links!.HYPERPOP BOPS !âœ° on Spotify by RIC0ðŸ”ªbubblegumðŸ”ª Spotify playlist by Ella LautierThe Sound of Hyperpop Spotify playlist by The Sounds of Spotifyhyperpop Spotify playlist by SpotifyHYPERPOP 2020 Spotify playlist by Veronica SteeleHyperpop / Bubblegum Bass / PC Music Spotify playlist by vaughnerichHYPERPOP Spotify playlist by LIQUORICEBITCHHYPERPOP Spotify playlist by ameerhyperpop Spotify playlist by mot99ziiHyperPop Orgies Spotify playlist by Justin Hugheshyperpop Spotify playlist by daniel.budachyperpop:the return of pop Spotify playlist by John DelfinoFIZZE BOM BAHH Spotify playlist by sleepyyjaxHyperpop Spotify Playlist by albertlbakerDrain Gang Spotify Playlist
