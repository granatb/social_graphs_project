Mori Kei (Ê£ÆÁ≥ª), also known originally as Mori Girl (Ê£Æ„Ç¨„Éº„É´) is a Japanese fashion that centers around an appearance inspired by living in the woods..In 2006, a community called "Mori Girl" was created on the Japanese social network Mixi. The name was chosen by its manager, Choco, after a friend commented on one of her outfits stating "You look like you are in the forest."The ‚ÄúMori Girl‚Äù Mixi community reached 35,000 people in 2009, and it caused a big boom that led to the creation of multiple mori kei magazines and brands such as Mori Girl Lesson magazines, Choco's Mori Girl Book, and the popular mori brand Wonder Rocket. The style also saw considerable popularity overseas, where the name Mori Kei began to be used, leading to the creation of various communities on social media and livejournal. However, in Japan, the style began to decline in the early 2010s, and magazines and brands declined with the end of its popularity.As of 2019, the online Mixi group about the origin of mori kei has been deleted, and the brand that has been worn at the highest of its popularity, "Wonder Rocket," also closed its Harajuku store in 2017.The heyday of the fashion might have passed, but since there still is a certain number of enthusiasts, the genre of mori kei itself has not disappeared. There are still brands catering to mori kei even though the design has changed to suit the present, as well as a still existing international online community..
