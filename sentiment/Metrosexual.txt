Metrosexual is a term used to refer to a man that makes sure that he looks good, and tends to spend a lot of time and money doing so. This term was coined in 1994, and is typically used to refer to a man living in an urban, post-industrial, consumerist culture. The term is a portmanteau of metropolitan and heterosexual, as metrosexuals often live in an urban, post-industrial, capitalist culture. The term today is outdated, as society's lean towards male body acceptance has accepted this type of self-care rather than fetishize or degrade it. The terms was also created as a way to voice confusion over whether or not a man was gay or not in the 90s, as stereotypes in the 90s against gay men ran high. .SuitsKhakisPolosBoat shoesDress shoes.Getting a pedicure (or even a manicure)Going to the gymShoppingSkincare.https://www.nytimes.com/2003/06/22/style/metrosexuals-come-out.htmlhttps://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/19/fashion/sundaystyles/gay-or-straight-hard-to-tell.htmlâ†‘ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metrosexual
