Comfy/Cozy is an aesthetic that relates to the feeling of being comfortably at rest with your surroundings, neatly fit in your place, relieved and well-suited. It includes having pets, reading books, and sitting next to a fireplace or window, or on a bed. Usually associated with Autumn and pumpkin spices, and with swift movements instead of challenges. Others also include reading, sleeping, watching movies or just doing nothing whilst at ease and petting your dog/cat.Specific themes associated are messy beds as the symbolize one's unwillingness to wake up, and dreams (either be asleep or wish to). While the aesthetic is not as predominant on the several social media sites out there yet, such as Instagram, TikTok, and others, the community notably began and prospered on Tumblr.It should be noted that this aesthetic sometimes is confused with Light Academia due to similar color palette and some key values. However, one main difference between the two is that Light Academia(and all aesthetics with the Academia suffix, for that matter) is that it is focused on learning, studying, and a thirst for knowledge. Comfy/Cozy's main idea is being comfortable, relaxed, and happy. .Elements of the Comfy/Cozy visual aesthetic include:Stuffed animalsPlaying on your electronicsAlways tiredBeds and SleepBeing terribly unorganizedWatching funny animal videosWatching YouTubeBags under your eyesThis cozy mood visual guideBaked goodsAromatherapy (candles, essential oils, incense, etc.)Warm drinksSoft lightingSweet treats.Relaxing hobbiesWriting/journalingPracticing mindfulness.Key fashion features include many things, usually not tight and very casual: Warm woolly socksSoft blanketsCardigansWarm beverage in a mugKnitted, woolly and oversized sweaters.Messy bunsGlassesScarvesFlannelSweatpantsGraphic pajamasNo MakeupSlippersClothes with animals on them.Coffee shop soundtrack (e.g. the Lumineers)HozierLordeChilljazz instrumentalGregory Alan Isakov (e.g. The Stable Song, Amsterdam, Living Proof, San Luis, Southern Star, San Francisco)Murder by Death - Lost RiverBear's Den (e.g. Sophie, Berlin, Above The Clouds Of Pompeii, Only Son of the Falling Snow)Johnny Flynn (Bulb Went Black, Shore to Shore)Tall Ships - HomeSarah Jarosz - Take Me BackOcie Elliott (e.g. Down By The Water, I Got You Honey, Stay Love, We Fall In)Caamp (e.g. Misty, 'So Long, Honey')Passenger (e.g. The Way That I Love You, 'Sometimes It's Something, Sometimes It's Nothing At All', Let Me Dream A While, Restless Wind)Taylor Swift (e.g. Folklore Album, Evermore Album)Animal Crossing OST (all the games)..Anne with an EOver the Garden WallFriendsBee and Puppycat.HyoukaAnohanaViolet EvergardenSound!
