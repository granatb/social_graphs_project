Content warning: mentions of alcohol, smoking, and sex.Flappers were young Western women in the 1920s who embraced a free lifestyle. They were known for their short skirts (here meaning knee-length) and shoulder-length hair. They also listened to jazz. Smoking, drinking, driving automobiles, and casual sex were another part of Flappers. Essentially, Flappers made their disdain for socially-acceptable female behavior known..Flappers came out of the increasing freedoms throughout the 1910s. Due to large numbers of men fighting in WWI, a significant number of women entered the workforce, exposing them to freedoms that many wanted to keep. Women's freedoms were further expanded with the passage of the 19th Amendment, giving them the right to vote. Improvements in birth control also contributed to the growing freedoms of women.Then the men came back from war. As Frederick Lewis Allen says in Only Yesterday, "(Women) found themselves expected to settle down into the humdrum routine of American life as if nothing had happened, to accept the moral dicta of elders who seemed to them still to be living in a Pollyanna land of rosy ideals which the war had killed for them. They couldn't do it, and they very disrespectfully said so.".In summary, flappers defied the previous norms by wearing short(er) skirts, makeup, and having short hair.Examples of flapper clothing include:Straight, up-and-down, knee-length or above, shift dresses, with no cleavage showingFor day: Heavy wool and tweedFor night: Fur, velvet, quilted satin, shimmering/shiny textured silk/rayonHighly visible, sheer, light-colored silk/rayon stockings fastened just above the knee with lace-adorned garters2-3 inch Mary Jane heels with button fastenings in black, gold, silver, or nudeColossal sparkly chandelier-style earringsCigarette holdersHair cut in a shingle bob cut with bangs or a pixie cutClose-fitting, pulled-down bell-shaped cloche hats to keep hair in placeBar arms with bangles layered up each armLong ropes of pearls or glass beadsClose-fitting beaded capsToques with gigantic fake flowers or beaded motifs attachedNarrow, sparkly scarves worn cravat-style or around the head, secured at the sideShawl-collar, wraparound coatsVelvet/fur opera coatsFox/mink stoles complete with heads and eyes attachedFeather boa is an acceptable substitute if you are ill at ease with wearing furSmall beaded bagsHorn-rimmed glassesKohl rimmed eyes, dark crimson cupid's bow lips, and bright cheeks with bright red blush.Coco Chanel - knitwearJeanne LanvinEdward MolyneuxJean Patou - important for knit swimwear and women's sportswearPaul PoiretElsa Schiaparelli - knitwearCallot SoeursMadeleine Vionnet - designs naturally emphasized shape of woman's body. 	 	 	 			   	 	 		 			 		 		 			1920s dances featuring the Charleston, the Peabody, Turkey Trot and more 		 		 	 This is a list of activities commonly associated with Flappers.DancingThe Charleston, Black Bottom, and Shimmy were popular.DrinkingDriving carsSexSmoking.This is a list of general places where Flappers went.Jazz clubsSpeakeasiesVaudeville shows.Clara BowLouise BrooksJosephine BakerColleen MooreGilda GrayZelda FitzgeraldDianna CooperNancy CunardTamara de LempickaTallulah Bankhead...This Side of Paradise by F.
