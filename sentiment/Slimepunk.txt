Slimepunk is a musical micro-genre that emerged in the early 2010s among Internet communities. It is characterized by an aesthetic dominated by slime related pop culture references, ranging from the Toxic Avenger, slime-time live, mountain-dew, and toxic waste. Similar to Vaporwave and Seapunk, this aesthetic is an integral part of the genre and characterizes the artists who dive into the Slimepunk movement. Slimepunk music often times features heavy & distorted bass-lines and has emerged largely from a post-acid scene. Slime-punk artists tend to have a more aggressive or corrosive ethos in combination with their music. While there is no specific slime-punk sound, the aesthetic is a common unifying factor, and most Slimepunk artists feature heavy sampling within their music..Slimepunk was popular among teens and tweens of the internet that was very similar to Seapunk, but with more of a focus on slime; a substance made with borax, glue, and water, among other add ins including glitter, fake snow, shaving cream, beads, charms, and more. It has been popularized on social media sites like YouTube and Instagram.  Popular elements of Slimepunk at the time include:SquishiesSlimeAcrylic NailsSlime ShopsYouTubeCute AccessoriesDIY Crafts. 	 	 	 		 		 		 	 Slimepunk is often described as Seapunk's darker twin, and to some extent that makes a lot of sense. Slimepunk brings us underground into a rat-infested and polluted sewer system. Some online commentators theorize thatSlimepunk is a reaction to the pollution of the environment and poisonous media trends prevalent in the world today. There is little evidence to suggest this, and as such, I feel that this is merely an attempt at attributing a purpose to the movement, as opposed to a genuine statement of the Slimepunk manifesto. Depending on who you ask, Slimepunk doesn’t even exist or rather…it always existed. Slimepunk, much like it’s Seafaring predecessor is rife with truisms and paradoxical statements..Yokai Candy.One major aspect of the Slimepunk sound is deep and growling synth basslines, generally with dripping sound effects and/or Acid-House influences. Some of the music approaches Acid-Tech in terms of sound but is distinct in its more atmospheric approach and loyalty to the overall Slimepunk themes of toxic waste and noxious sewer gas. Other Slimepunk music has none of these features but still exists within the movement. Slimepunk is based on aesthetic, and it is that aesthetic that ties all the different sounds together. Slimepunk the musical genre may not exist necessarily, but the movement definitely exists and musical representations of the core Slimepunk aesthetic can definitely be found..Bleep BloopPoison IvoryLE1FSludge JunkiesPolymorphingNastyNastyVandalazeN3rgulTennis RodmanPROPANEPROKOsadguru.
