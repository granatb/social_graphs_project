Gloomcore is an aesthetic inspired by the tranquil forests and foggy beaches of the pacific northwest, and obscure hobbies and interests. The aim is to appreciate the quiet through dim surroundings. Those who take a liking to such genre tend to find beauty in cloudy skies, foggy coastlines and tall, endless, green forests. Gloomcore folks love all things odd and otherworldly.  .Forests with moss, lots of plants, tall trees, and fog covering up the tops of the trees are the noticeable things you can find in forests that aren't bustling with energy or have any crowded spaces. Another good example is a hazy beach with no sun anywhere to be seen, just light brown sand and water with slow, grey waves stretching for miles.As said in the description, most places revolve around forests and beaches. Though there also might be rivers, streams, lakes, and other bodies of water, even puddles! Moors, mountains and other landforms where you can overlook a beautiful view are also appreciated natural aspects of Gloomcore. People who associate themselves with this aesthetic tend to focus on irregular and wondrous things or ideas, like the angle of light on water, cryptid sightings and long forest walks.The weather is supposed to have mellow, sort of dreamy undertones that possibly lead to long thought processes and the bubbling of one's imagination. Though something like the rain, cold seasons, fall, winter, thunderstorms and lightning storms are prevalent, quiet foggy days count as well..The clothes must be related to the dull, mysterious atmosphere and cold weather. Some of the items are:Oversized, loose fitting clothingPullover sweatersCorduroy pants and jacketsMom jeansVintage graphic teesOverall pants/shortsPleated skirtsRipped/patterned tightsLeg warmersCombat/hiking bootsSlip on converse or vansArgyle sweater vestsRaincoats.Although the most prominent activity in Gloomcore is enjoying spending one's time looking at the aspects of nature, there are other things, such as:GardeningReadingWritingPhotographySketching or painting natural scenesCryptid huntingCollecting cute/weird objects.Because of the nature this aesthetic is based on, Gloomcore music is soft, based on the ideas of being in nature and other Gloomcore hobbies.
