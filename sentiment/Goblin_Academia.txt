Goblin Academia is the cross between Goblincore and Academia, especially Green Academia and Chaotic Academia. Goblincore primarily focuses on the appreciation of aspects of nature which are normally overlooked, such as snails and mushrooms. Goblin Academia takes this a step further into studying these parts of nature. Itâ€™s for this reason why Goblin Academia could be seen as a sub-genre of Green Academia. Whereas Dark Academics are known for studying literature, art, and history, and Green Academics are known for studying Earth Sciences, a Goblin Academic would likely be interested in any or all of these fields. They would especially be interested in studying Nature-based literature, art, Mythology, botany, geology, and zoology..MushroomsMagical creaturesAntique and/or old booksFern and mossMessy houses or roomsOvergrown cottagesOld forestsMoss and flowers growing on literally everythingAntique accessories..Loose blousesLight blousesOxford shirtsBlousonsJumpersCamisolesSweater vestsFlannelsSweatersTurtlenecksT-shirts.High-waisted pantsHigh-waisted shortsWorn or customized overallsAnkle pantsDress pantsCustomized or worn jeansPleated skirts.PinaforesSummer dresses.CardigansPea coatsWaistcoatsAprons.Mary JanesChelsea bootsDr. MartinsRain bootsCombat bootsHiking bootsChunky lace up boots.Customized stone jewelryPatterned and colorful socksBelt satchelsOversized glassesLoosely tied tiesLeather satchelMismatched, unique socksAlchemist pouchesEnamel pinsPocket watchesGolden or silver ringsPolaroid camerasFanny packsBackpacksTote bags..The Narnia Series - C.S LewisThe Harry Potter series - J.K RowlingThe Hobbit - J.R.R TolkienThe Lord Of The Rings Series - J.R.R Tolkien.Boys will be bugs - CavetownLemon Boy - Cavetown..WritingDrawingPaintingCrochetEmbroideryPhotographyBotanyStudying.ReadingDaydreamingJournalingWatering plantsWatching the rainAttempting deals with faeStar-gazingWashing rock collectionFollowing dreamsBecoming one with the forest by sitting in moss for extended periods of time.GoblincoreGoblin Academia Reddit..https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkAcademia/comments/i0pbv6/new_aesthetic_proposal_goblin_academia/https://www.pinterest.ph/pin/676525175273392547/https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkAcademia/comments/o6xtty/attention_goblin_academia/
