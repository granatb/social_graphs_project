Acidwave is centered around visuals inspired by depictions of hallucinations caused by hallucinogenic drugs, especially lysergic acid diethylamide, colloquially known as acid, from which the aesthetic derives its name. It started as a subgenre of House music that was popular in raves (which could draw some comparisons to Raver culture) but has evolved into a full blown aesthetic in its own right..Acidwave visuals have a very melty, psychedelic, and colorful appearance, often drawing upon the tie-dye imagery that was popular in the days of the Hippies. Despite that, some Acidwave aesthetic imagery can have a dark, unsettling vibe to them (like a bad acid trip) as well as a peaceful, tranquil vibe (like a good acid trip).Extra: Film: The hotel on acid (1998).Acid Wave by Maggie.M.âš¡AESTHETIC: acidwave/psychedelica by Chaotic GoodAcidwave ðŸŽ† Spotify playlist by Cesar NietoaCiD wAvE Spotify playlist by lceman_333acidwave Spotify playlist by celadatatiAcid House Spotify playlist by the folks at SpotifyThe Sound of Acid House Spotify playlist by The Sounds of SpotifyIntro to Acid HouseThe Pulse of Acid HouseThe Edge of Acid HouseA â™€Filter for Acid House.Acidwave board by Maggie.M.
