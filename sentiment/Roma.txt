The Roma aesthetic is based on 19th and 20th century Romani population fashion, style and way of life. In certain communities, mysticism and religion hold an important place.Romani/Romany, are an Indo-Aryan ethnic group mostly living in Europe, but can be found all over the world. Traditionally the group was nomadic, but permanent living has become more common (although it depends on the country they are living in). Roma generally place a high value on the extended family and tend to live and marry with other Roma. There is a distinct way of living, Romanipen (also romanypen, romanipe, romanype, romanimos, romaimos, romaniya) that encompasses traditions, laws, philosophies etc. However the concept is interpreted differently depending on the Romani group and what country they live in.The Roma people have a rich culture and have faced racism and discrimination, even to this day. One example is the word gypsy, which is a derogatory term that many gadjo (masculine)/gadji (feminine) (non-Romani, in Angloromani: gorja ) use without knowing it is harmful.
