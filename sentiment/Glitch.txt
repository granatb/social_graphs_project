Thank you.Glitch is a short-lived fault in a system, such as a transient fault that corrects itself, making it difficult to troubleshoot. The term is particularly common in the computing and electronics industries, in circuit bending, as well as among players of video games. More generally, all types of systems including human organizations and nature experience glitches.A glitch, which is slight and often temporary, differs from a more serious software bug which is a genuine functionality-breaking problem. Alex Pieschel, writing for Arcade Review, said: "‚Äúbug‚Äù is often cast as the weightier and more blameworthy pejorative, while ‚Äúglitch‚Äù suggests something more mysterious and unknowable inflicted by surprise inputs or stuff outside the realm of code.".The glitched look is frequently featured in both Vaporwave and Lo-Fi works (with the rare instance it shows up in some Synthwave videos when it's trying to completely replicate the 80's look, like it's a lost video showing its age)..Glitch FashionDataerase..Digicore (also people call it glitchcore).glitchcore <3 playlist by cbelle06Genre Glitch Official Spotify PlaylistxXx_gLiTcHcOrE_xXx playlist by ashleighGLITCHCORE playlist by plewin1GLITCH playlist by TATUMGLITCHCORE üòºüòºüòπüòª playlist by isabellakioover 40 hours of hyperpop glitchcore and escape room by cool nameblack cuff beanie Spotify PlaylistDrain Gang Spotify Playlist 	 	 	 			   	 	 		 		 			Bubblegum-0 		 		 	 .Datamosh, (or Databending) is a complex glitch technique where the movement in one layer of video is applied to another layer of footage, using glossy compression and removed frames to create a glitchy, psychedelic result. .
