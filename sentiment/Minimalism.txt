Also, the minimalism side is heavily influenced by the bright colors and clean lines of Bauhaus and Modernist design..Indie style means basically just whatever feels right based on your personal aesthetic, and usually involves avoiding mainstream labels. Minimalism is just what it sounds like: a little. This often means a spare, neutral palette, clean lines, and a focus on function and practicality first.

It can be described as clean, light, simple, functional, and minimal.Matcha often employs the use of a single muted color, or a muted color palette, against a white or black backdrop. Common materials include brushed metal, wood, paper, matte plastic, cork, felt, and ceramic.Matcha design encourages sensory specificity as a means to turning daily experiences into pleasing rituals. Accordingly, it overlaps with some vintage technologies whose daily usage conjures sounds, smells, and textures (eg. vinyl record albums, cassette tapes, mechanical typewriters, and paper stationery).Typographic elements are carefully crafted in Matcha design, and often feature as part of, rather than simply accessory to, the overall design of an object.Matcha draws from the simplicity of minimalism, but places an added emphasis on sensory delight. While it shares some elements with Comfy/Cozy, including a ritualized ease in daily activities, it is not confined to a set of behaviors. Similarly, it overlaps with the warmth of Coffee House, but with an added emphasis on the experience of objects in themselves, and not simply as part of a larger environment..POSTALCOKANSOMUJIKINTOFjallraven.Yoshitomo Nara.Ryuichi Sakamoto.Making tea or coffeeDrinking tea or coffeeTyping on the computerReading a bookTidying a roomLighting a candlePutting on a vinyl record......https://www.theartstory.org/movement/minimalism/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimalism Wikipedia
