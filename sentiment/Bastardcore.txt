Bastardcore is supposed to strike your fight or flight response. It consists of friendly images along with shock humor themed captions or images that seem out of place and are uncomfortable to look at. One could argue that Bastardcore is an extension of the "cursed images'" meme. This aesthetic is commonly used by people who would refer to themselves as "feral"..Bastardcore visuals are designed to be shocking, mildly offensive by nature, and "cursed" by nature, all in an attempt to make other people as uncomfortable as humanly possible..Bastardcore fashion can easily blend in with any other fashion-based aesthetics, common clothes and accessories include ripped jeans and graphic tees, hoodies with strange quotes on them, handmade earrings, and platform shoes or combat boots.Bastardcore VendorsGood Vietnam ShirtsWicked ClothesBoredwalkBusted TeesTee RepublicHeadline ShirtsSynthicideT-Shirt Hell.[bastard noises Spotify playlist by bastard babeyBastard Milescore Spotify playlist by Arg Argargarg🖕🏻♠️💥*°.Alternative bastardcore.°*💥♠️🖕🏻 Spotify playlist by i2703gr2c9x2ns17g8nsr8kolabsolutely fucking feral Spotify playlist by d. layne𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘢𝘶𝘥𝘪𝘢𝘭 𝘦𝘲𝘶𝘪𝘷𝘢𝘭𝘦𝘯𝘵 𝘰𝘧 𝘣𝘢𝘴𝘵𝘢𝘳𝘥𝘤𝘰𝘳𝘦 Spotify playlist by vuvudesu𝑏𝑎𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑑𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒 Spotify playlist by 𝑠 𝑣 𝑒 𝑎BC Spotify playlist by ZopitaCursed Playlist Spotify playlist by Yuki Katsucursed music Spotify playlist by Henbocursed songs Spotify playlist by marienverumCursed Times Spotify playlist by TabiCurseds vibes Spotify playlist by unclesam.
