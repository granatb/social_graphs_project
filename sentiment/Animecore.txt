Animecore is an aesthetic revolving around the visual culture of Japanese anime and manga. Often glorifying Japanese animation styles prevalent in the 1990s through early 2000s as well as "VOCALOID," a musical computer software that uses anime visuals. Animecore tends to overlap with other aesthetic genres, like Cartooncore, Vaporwave, Webcore, Cyberpunk or Scene, due to Animecore's rise in reaction to "cringe culture" that is increasingly prevalent on the internet.Animecore is not anime itself, but rather the images consumed outside the context of the stories anime is conveying. The aesthetic culture here is the Western fans of the Japanese genre, rather than the artistic environment within anime, which can encompass multiple aesthetics. Frequent motifs are "Magical Girl Anime", such as Sailor Moon, Cardcaptor Sakura, Tokyo Mew Mew and other anime, like Lucky Star, VOCALOID song PVs, anime-related YouTube videos from 2007-2012, pastel manga edits, Touhou, gaudy Blingee-esque edits and frequently stolen and edited art from the early 2000s that was often parallel to Scene and Emo culture. Ball-jointed dolls and anime figures are also popular. Sometimes, distortion methods are used to lower image quality to replicate the look of many old web artifacts..The primary visual of Animecore is Moe characters, who evoke feelings of affection within viewers. They are always young girls with large eyes, colorful and distinctive hairstyles, and kawaii outfits such as school and maid uniforms. Images of bedrooms cluttered with anime merchandise, such as posters, figurines, and banners show the simultaneously obsessive and cozy feelings that Animecore conveys.  .Animecore fashion is normally centered around either a particular anime or around the anime aesthetic in general.
