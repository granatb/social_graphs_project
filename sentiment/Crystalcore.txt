Crystalcore is an aesthetic centered around crystal shapes and gemstones of any variety; clear or opaque, multicolored or monochrome, raw or polished. This can range from loose standing crystals, beads, embellishments, jewelry, and much more. Minerals have been found in many locations all over the world and many have associated meanings and alleged special properties. Different cultures and communities vary in beliefs of the special properties crystals may have. Communities and entities that utilize crystals for these meaning range from witches and pagans for use in practice to misguided claims they work better than medicine. .Crystalcore visuals focus, obviously, on crystals. It's one of the few aesthetics that, alone, can be very beautiful and magical, but it can only be accentuated by blending with other aesthetics, especially the more colorful aesthetics (given the variety of colors that can crystals can come in) or magical aesthetics (given the association of some crystals with the supernatural) though that's not to say it can't blend with aesthetics that don't fall under those categories. Crystalcore can also be seen very frequently in Icepunk, Seapunk, Pearly, and Vaporwave in particular, given the ethereal nature of the three (and Icepunk in particular deals with ice, which can take on a crystalline appearance itself).As for entertainment associated with Crystalcore, one can either watch the JTV channel on YouTube or Steven Universe on Cartoon Network.Crystalcore fashion follows the example of the crystal; bright, colorful, and shiny.

Holographic items work just as well, as well as anything beaded or embellished. ..Houseki no KuniSacred Seven.Steven Universe.A lot of Crystalcore music can have a "glittery" sound like you're walking through an ice cave or into a room covered in shiny jewels.
