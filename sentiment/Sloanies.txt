This page needs work.Sloanie, Sloane or Sloane Ranger is a stereotypical young upper-middle or upper class British person who pursues a distinctive fashionable lifestyle. Sometimes these people are referred to as "Posh" but it is important to note that not all posh people are Sloanes. Probably, the most famous example of this subculture was Diana Spencer, before and around the time she married Prince Charles. Another notable example is the TV character Tim Nice-But-Dim, an Old Ardinian.The term is a humorous combination of "Sloane Square", a location in Chelsea, London, famed for the wealth of residents and frequenters, and the television character The Lone Ranger..The Sloane Ranger has roots in the English upper classes. Families were peers of the Realm (members of the Royal Family or those with titles presented by the Royal Family) or landed gentry (people who controlled estates and received income from tenants renting land on the estate). Men in these families were members of the House of Lords, who had huge influence on British government and society.During the British colonial era, British aristocrats settled in Australia, Canada, India and the United States. In the United States, they formed the WASP and Preppy subcultures, which can be very similar to the Sloane Ranger aesthetic.In the 1920s, many of the old estates fell into disrepair due to rising costs and the decline of the servant class. Today many old estates are museums and historical sites. Other estates which remain in the family are rented out for movie and television productions, such as Highclare Castle, the setting for Downton Abbey. Despite the "poverty" of the aristocracy (relative to their ancestors), an old family name or title gives a Sloane status.Part of the Sloane Ranger aesthetic is a sense of nostalgia for the past, whether it be the 18th century, or the 1920s-1950s. The nostalgia tends to be very patriotic, romanticizing British history and historical figures such as Winston Churchill and members of the Royal Family and ignoring the dark side of British imperialism..Most of the things that Sloanes value are very old. They do not like or trust things which are new, foreign, or French.English Patriotism, including extreme loyalty to the Queen and the Royal Family"Good Schools" - Eton, Harrow, Oxford, Cambridgenoble titlespedigree dogspedigree horsesGeorgian era antique furniturejewelry and silver passed down from family members.Places and things associated with the English upper classes. There is some crossover with Dark and Light Academia aesthetics because many Sloanes attend boarding school and later prestigious universities such as Cambridge, Oxford, and St. Andrews.A country house or estateBritish patriotic imagery such as the Union Flag and images of the QueenEnglish village lifeHorses and equestrian imageryMany dogs, especially hunting breeds like labradors, Jack Russells, King Charleses, Irish SettersOil paintings of ancestorsScottish tartans and similar plaidsThe Cotswoldschickens.Clothing is generally modest and long lasting. Royal Warrants can be issued to brands which produce high quality goods favored by the Queen, the Duke of Edinburgh, and the Prince of Wales. Warrants can be revoked if the actions of the company displeases the person who issued it. Rigby & Peller, which provided the Queen's undergarments, had its warrant revoked in 2018.Natural fibers like cotton, wool, and silk are favored. The English insistence on maintaining their traditional dress codes, despite being impractical for the climate of India or the Caribbean, is often mocked in fiction.Blazers in red and navy blueAran aka Fisherman sweatersFaire Isle sweatersCardigansKilts (men) or pleated skirts (women) in the family tartanLiberty print shirts and dressesWax jackets (especially ones from Barbour)PashminaPearl necklaces and earringsPolo shirtsRemembrance Poppy (poppy shaped pin worn in November to commemorate veterans of the British Armed Forces)Riding bootsRain boots aka welliesSilk dressing gownSkinny jeansTennis whites and cricket whites (white sweater and pants or skirt)Tweed suit and flat cap for hunting (men).Makeup is generally natural, with products used to enhance features.
