Kingcore is a variant of Royalcore that revolves around the imagery and power of portrayed kings in history, folklore, and fictional work. Like Queencore is to Princesscore, Kingcore is a more mature variant of Princecore. Themes of power, war, and conquest are more often seen here, as kings are most often viewed as malicious entities; although this is not true for all works or historical accounts. Kingcore aesthetics show through strength and guidance, skill and patience. Those who adopt a Kingcore aesthetic may be seen as the leader of a group. They hold themselves to higher standards, as a way to show worthiness of their title and position. The Kingcore aesthetic wouldn't be complete without confidence and displays of good leadership. A different approach using evil kings as inspiration can prove ill-advised, as this may make the person appear selfish and inconsiderate with a disregard for others.Inspiration can be drawn from patriarchal figures in hierarchy-centered shows and movies, especially those centered around kingdoms. For a darker approach, colors can be toned deeper, and inspiration can be drawn from evil king characters and CEOs. This aesthetic can be great inspiration for modern styles..Visuals for kingcore coincide with other royalcore visuals.
