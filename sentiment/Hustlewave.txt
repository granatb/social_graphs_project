Due to the controversial actions of many capitalist regimes throughout the world and in history, the Aesthetics Wiki does not support the human rights violations and war crimes committed by these movements, but it is important to acknowledge the importance that capitalism has had on world history and its impact on modern culture. Viewer discretion is advised.“I believe in total immersion, if you want to be rich, you have to program your mind to be rich. You have to unlearn all the thoughts that were making you poor and replace them with new thoughts – rich thoughts.” - Jordan Belfort         Hustlewave is an aesthetic that is rooted in capitalist and opportunist thought. It's an amalgamation of Futurism and right wing economic schools of thought (like Objectivism). Think of the classic rags to riches success story, kid makes cool tech in his garage, fast forward 15 years and he's a techbro blamed for the increase of housing prices in the San Francisco/Bay Area. Hustlewave in its purest form is gaining power and succeeding in life through money rather than politics. Though Hustlewave is also about managing to bring the future to today, and making a profit off of it.  In many ways, Hustlewave is the polar opposite of the anti-capitalist/anti-consumerist notes often found in a genre like Vaporwave and is the polar opposite; the Laborwave aesthetic, with it's goal being to become the Techbro/Cyberprep equivalent to Vaporwave's Cyberpunk..Hustlewave visuals are, quite literally, Vaporwave aesthetics without the irony and critique of late-stage capitalism, instead openly embracing late-stage capitalism.Hustlewave fashion is rarely inexpensive. If you are going for a vintage Hustlewave look it consists of business wear. If you're going for a more modern look invest in techwear, such as tactical belts, black hiking boots, and tactical cargo pants. As icing on the cake, an electric vehicle goes nice with your modern techwear look. This is where the neon comes into play, decorate your onewheel or ebike with neon lights and colors..Films to watch to get an idea of HustlewaveJobs (2013)The Social Network (2010)American Psycho (2000)Limitless (2011)Something Ventured (2011)Ctrl+Alt+Compete (2011)The Wolf of Wall Street (2013)The Godfather (1970).Some music the creator of this aesthetic considers to be the epitome of Hustlewave: 9 to 5 by Dolly PartonStarted From The Bottom by DrakeStronger by Kanye WestSee Me Now by Kanye WestRise Up by PennywiseActual Hustlewave music hasn't been created yet, but one could imagine that it's just Vaporwave music without the irony, sarcasm, and melancholic vibe to it (so basically, it would just be the music that's sampled for Vaporwave, but without any of the distortion and effects put onto it and just existing as is before the effects are put on to create the unique soundscape)...Subgenre of Hustlewave with much more political overtones, promoted by Spanish liberals with the intention of turning Spain into an economic power, following some examples of policy carried out in Madrid..
