Tweencore is an aesthetic that shares some similarities with Kidcore, maintaining the nostalgic and "childish" themes, but also embodying teen spirit often associated with the High School Dream aesthetic. It tends to borrow heavily from Animecore (especially more feminine animes like Sailor Moon and Fruits Basket), Scene, and Old Web (while also taking some fashion cues from the McBling aesthetic that this was inspired by). Its aesthetic is centered around the preadolescent period of the ages of 10 to 14, so while there is certainly a lot of pink involved (like you'd expect from Kidcore for girls), it's a slightly refined usage of the color pink. There's also an emphasis on Disney Show sitcoms like Hannah Montana and Disney princesses as well..Tweencore aesthetics involve lots of pinks and purples, pretty anime girls, old internet messengers from a bygone era (especially MSN Messanger and AIM), Disney princesses, and a developing rebellious spirit. One may also see Boy Band/Pop Princess/teen idol images pop up in the Tweencore aesthetic as well..Tweencore fashion involves lots of miniskirts, tank tops, babydoll-style shirts, sneakers, socks, and involves pinks and purples. The more feminine styles had flower, rainbow, and heart graphics and patterns. Less girly tweens wore Scene influenced outfits, which combined bright colors with black..Abercrombie and Fitch/Abercrombie KidsAeropostale/P.S. from AeropostaleAmerican ApparelAmerican Eagle/77 Kids by American EagleDelia'sForever 21Gilly HicksHollisterJustice & BrothersLimited Too.(Under Construction).The Sims.Clueless (1995)Legally Blonde (2001) and Legally Blonde 2 (2003)Cadet Kelly (2002)Get A Clue (2002)The Lizzie McGuire Movie (2003)A Cinderella Story (2004)Ella Enchanted (2004)New York Minute (2004)Mean Girls (2004)The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants (2005)Aquamarine (2006)Flicka (2006)Just My Luck (2006)Hairspray (2007)Nancy Drew (2007).Sabrina the Teenage Witch (1996-2003)Lizzie McGuire (2001-2004)Winx Club (2004-)H2O: Just Add Water (2006-2010)That's So Raven (2003-2007)The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air (1990-1996)The Nanny (1993-1999)SpongeBob Squarepants (1999-2021)Rugrats (1991-2006)The Powerpuff Girls (1998-2005)The Fairly OddParents (2001-2017)Kim Possible (2002-2007)Buffy the Vampire Slayer (1997-2003).External links to help get a better understanding of this aesthetic..https://www.pinterest.com/stuffedanimallover2006/tweencore/https://www.pinterest.com/aestheticsthemes/tweencore-aesthetic/https://www.pinterest.com/mehrkiana/tweencore/https://www.pinterest.com/nini04ni/tweencore/https://www.pinterest.com/h0pewurld_/tweencore-band/https://www.pinterest.com/2003kiid/tweencore/.
