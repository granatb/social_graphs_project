Surrealism is a cultural movement that started in 1917, and is best known for its visual artworks and writings. Artists painted unnerving, illogical scenes, sometimes with photographic precision, creating strange creatures from everyday objects, and developing painting techniques that allowed the unconscious to express itself. Its aim was, according to Breton, to "resolve the previously contradictory conditions of dream and reality into an absolute reality, a super-reality", or surreality..Surrealism rejected any rational version of life, and favored a vision that was influenced by dreams and the unconscious mind. Some surrealists would draw or write without paying much attention to what they were creating, while others sought to depict their dream worlds. .Jean ArpAndre BretonLeonora CarringtonSalvador DalíPaul DelvauxMax ErnstAndré MassonRené MagritteJoan MiróPaul NashMeret OppenheimPierre RoyKay SageYves TanguyDorothea Tanning..https://www.theartstory.org/movement/surrealism/
