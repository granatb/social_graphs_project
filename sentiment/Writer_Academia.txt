Writer Academia is an aesthetic that revolves around the art of writing, be it poetry, novels, or even fanfiction. It is centered around the idea that writing is for everyone, and the quality of work does not matter as long as you are passionate about it and having fun. It is the romanticization of writing and literature, in any and all forms..Fake ads for your storyFlash fictionMorning PagesLettersPitches for your storiesWriting.Creating playlists for your WIPsMaking a Pinterest board for your bookChanging story perspectiveUsing creative writing promptsRoleplaying written works with a friendHost/join a writing clubJoin a writing-based discord serverDraw your OC'sMaking moodboardsStaying up all night writingDeveloping a coffee/tea addictionMaking a list of words that you loveWriting and studying words on your hands at 3 A.M.Losing yourself in fictional worldsCreating new universes and wishing they were realHaving too many OC'sCarrying a notebook on your person at all timesSeeing things in your day-to-day life that remind you of your characters/world/bookSpending an absurd amount of money on writing programs and stationaryBecoming alarmingly attached to your OC'sShipping your own charactersDrawing maps of your fictional worldsNever letting people read what you're working on but itching to tell them everything about your charactersConstantly daydreamingProcrastination.Naked on CashmereWelcome to Night ValeAround the Campfire: A Writing WorkshopThe Writer's Voice    .The Writer's Way by Julia CameronThe Writer's Way: Morning Pages by Julia CameronWriter's Digest magazineThe Writer's Idea Thesaurus by Fred WhiteMaking a Literary Life by Carolyn SeeBird by Bird by Anne LamottOn Writing by Stephen King .HozierThe NeighbourhoodLordeGang of YouthsLana Del ReyConan GrayBon IverEdenThe 1975Alec BenjaminChilled Cow (Now ‘Lofi Girl’)Arctic Monkeys.The Writer Academia style revolves around comfort and fashion, taking much inspiration from Dark Academia..Dress shirtsDenim jacketsTurtlenecksPlaid shirtsOxford shirtsLight blousesLarge polo necksSoft, comfortable sweaters (such as knitted or wool)BlazersSuit jacketsTrenchcoatsOvercoats    .Distressed jeansSkirtsPlaid skirtsDress pantsPlaid pants    .OxfordsDoc MartensMary Janes.GlassesSilver or gold jewelrySimple ringsSatchelsBelts that match your shoesWatchesSweaters tied over the shouldersUndone or loose ties.Thick, comfortable socksKnee-high socksReading socksWearable blankets/ponchosShort, neat fingernails    .Barnes & NobleDymocksChapters IndigoEtsyMoleskineYou Decide Who You Are (poet collection)   .WattpadFanfictionAO3 / Archive of Our OwnWriters Helping WritersWordhippoNameberryBehind the NameNaNoWriMoSheWritesCampfire TechnologyScrivenerGrammarlyFor extra resources not listed here, click here..Feel free to add your favourite Writer Academia accounts here.writeracademia (Instagram)writeracademia (tumblr)Official Discord_gabysena (Instagram)Aesthetic ♦︎ Writer Academia ♦︎ by Silverz (Pinterest)..writer academia.
