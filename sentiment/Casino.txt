Casino is an aesthetic that is based around the theme of casinos, gambling and coin games.Casinos are designed to create a pleasant atmosphere to reduce stress and convey a "playground" environment, thus encouraging patrons to spend more money.In some ways, Casino can be paired very well with both Cartelcore and Stripcore, since all three cater to "deadly" vices (Cartelcore caters to greed, gluttony, and sometimes wrath, Stripcore to lust, and Casino purely to greed)..Casino visuals will have a strong focus on Casino culture and Casino games, and feature a lot of neon lights, Slot machines, pool tables, and alcohol. From there the aesthetics diverges into two different kinds of Casino: High Roller and Tourist.High Roller Casino will generally carry more of an air of opulence and elegance, touching into Boujee territory.Tourist Casino, meanwhile, has more of a relaxed, playful, and fun atmosphere to it.  It's nothing serious, just going out and having some clean, adult fun. Tourist Casino notes that, while it would be nice to strike it big, it's ultimately just about the fun and not getting overboard with gambling away all of your money..High Roller Casino fashion includes formalwear and can share a lot in common with the Lounge aesthetic. High Roller Casino individuals tend to hang around the table games (Poker, Roulette, Blackjack, etc)Tourist Casino fashion tends to be a bit more lax (simple t-shirts and what not) and shares a lot in common with Vacation Dadcore, with added fanny pack for fun effect.  Tourist Casino individuals will tend to hang around the Slot machines and other games of that nature...Oceans 11Oceans 12Oceans 13One Eyed Jack's from Twin PeaksMoney Plane.KakeguruiKaiji..Casino Music playlist by rperringsCasino Playlist playlist by itsemerykCasino Night Playlist playlist by Nathan LoeschCasino Jazz playlist by Pascal Huitema.
