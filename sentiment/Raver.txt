A raver is a person who regularly goes to raves. Raves are an organized dance party at a nightclub, outdoor festival, warehouse, or other private property typically featuring performances by DJs, playing a seamless flow of electronic dance music. DJs at rave events play electronic dance music on vinyl, CDs, and digital audio from a wide variety of genres, including techno, hardcore, house, bassline, dubstep, New Beat, and post-industrial. Ravers commonly wear clothing that is bright and/or neon coloured..In many ways, the Madchester scene laid the groundwork for today's raver aesthetic. Madchester, the predecessor to modern raver culture, is a musical and cultural scene that developed in the English city of Manchester in the late 1980s. It saw artists merging alternative rock with elements of acid house, rave music, psychedelia, and 1960s pop. Madchester's decline gave way to the Britpop sound that became popular in the mid-to-late 90's thanks to bands like Blur and Oasis. Madchester was known for having a very rich drug scene, with the popular drug of choice being ecstacy (aka MDMA/Molly/E); in fact, Madchester band The Shamen put out a song called "Ebeneezer Goode" which was coded to be all about dropping E..Madchester fashion is the main reason for another name for the genre; Baggy. Baggy pants and shorts were quite popular back in Madchester's heyday and were often accompanied by tie-dye shirts of some sort. It can best be described as equal parts raver, hippie/retro (for its time), and football hooligan.  Over time, however, as Madchester/raver culture became more mainstream, raver fashion moved away from the warehouse parties into more extensive venues and outdoor spaces. Some of the new raver fashion that's come about includes:KandiComfortable shoesBreathable clothingBackpack/fanny PackHydration packFace mask/bandanaSunglassesFace glitter and jewelsNeon/UV reactive gearFluffy hoodiesGlow-in-the-dark accessories.There are multiple genres of music that have their association with the Raver aesthetic, such as:.Drum and bass (also written as Drum&Bass or drum'n'bass and commonly abbreviated as D&B, DnB, or D'n'B) is a genre of electronic music characterised by fast breakbeats (typically 165-185 beats per minute) with heavy bass and sub-bass lines, samples, and synthesizers. The genre grew out of the UK's jungle scene in the early 1990s. There have also been many subgenres and fusions of DnB.

The sound waves are often modulated using automation or low-frequency oscillation controlling the cutoff of an audio filter (typically a low- or high-pass filter), or the wave's amplitude, to adjust the waveform (to create a â€˜wobblyâ€™ effect on its parameters). In addition, it is common to utilize a somewhat "twinkly"-sounding gradual rise in pitch during "risers" (gradual pre-drop buildups of white noise), and arpeggio chords, vocal chops, or vocoders.

It is distinguished by faster tempos (160 to 200 BPM or more), the intensity of the kicks and the synthesized bass (in some subgenres), the rhythm and the atmosphere of the themes (sometimes violent), the usage of saturation and experimentation close to that of industrial dance music. It would spawn subgenres such as gabber..Under construction.As described above, Madchester music combined alternative rock with acid house, techno, psychedelica and the 1960's pop sound, with some of the big bands in the scene primarily coming from Manchester (hence the name). The music first started gaining headway from a club called the HaÃ§ienda (owned by members of legendary New Wave band New Order) and kicked off what came to be known as The Second Summer of Love. Bands within the genre include:Happy MondaysThe Stone RosesInspiral CarpetsThe ShamenEMFThe Charlatans808 StateThe Mock Turtles 	 	 	 			   	 	 		 		 			The Shamen, Phorever people, Directed by Richard Heslop, 1992 		 		 			If you need Madchester distilled into video form... here you go. 		 	 It was being predicted at the time that Madchester would become the defining sound of the 90's, but other genres (such as grunge) prevented it to ever happen. The Madchester sound eventually gave way to the rise of shoegaze and britpop; so while Madchester didn't become the decade-defining sound, it did continue to be an influential genre of music in its own right.As time went on, however, the psychedelica and indie rock vibes started falling away from the raver sound in favor of a more purely electronic sound, which gave rise to techno, trance, jungle, drum 'n bass, and so on, arriving into the era of modern EDM, which can be separated into its subgenres..Mainstream Hardcore is a subgenre of hardcore techno. The essence of mainstream hardcore sound is a distorted bass drum sound, overdriven to the point where it becomes clipped into a distorted square wave and makes a recognizably melodic tone. .Under construction.Under construction.Under construction..The Madchester scene has inspired numerous movies, chief among them being 24 Hour Party People (2002) and Trainspotting (1996)..External links to help get a better understanding of this aesthetic.VendorsInto The AMiHeartRavesRave WonderlandiEDMRaveReadyFreedom Rave WearOn Cue ApparelEtere (prices are extremely high.)Electro ThreadsUltraPoiKikwearUFOSet4LyfeSpace TribeTetramodeYour Mind Your WorldElectric StylesShanti BantiInlightenAll-Over Shirts by LumiThe HeadspaceFuturistic Lights.The Sound of EDM Spotify playlist by The Sounds of SpotifyIntro to EDMThe Pulse of EDMThe Edge of EDMA â™€Filter for EDMe-girl warehouse rave Spotify playlist by Ella LautierrEaL rAvEr Spotify playlist by BigfeetbigballsRAVER Spotify playlist by Simon Feuerpfeildark raver Spotify playlist by grashof-esendamwooks and ravers Spotify playlist by Tim MartinTIKTOK RAVERSðŸ˜œ Spotify playlist by adele.tondu.
