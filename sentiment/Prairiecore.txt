Prairiecore is based off of the life of the American pioneers and life on the prairie. Batsheva Hay describes her inspiration to be the "eccentric" tastes of her mother and grandmother. Though inspired by the U.S, Prairiecore is not limited to the United States. Like the American pioneers, this aesthetic finds power in freedom and experimenting with new things by using the old as inspiration. Its fashion has both a traditional and modern variant (Uptown Prairie). Key things are grasslands, cattle, flowers, wheat, and Pioneer related works. Prairiecore emerged from the American boho aesthetic during the 1970's, as an offshoot of the hippie/ flowerchild movement. The brand Gunne Sax by Jessica popularized prairie dresses in boho culture at the time, and continues to influence modern prairiecore style..Horseback ridingSewingBakingReadingPicnickingDancingSwimmingFarmingPlaying string instrumentsHanging out with animalsCandle making..BlousesAnything with ruffled sleevesFloral pattern.Paperbag pantsLong skirtsHigh waist pants.BonnetsStraw HatsApronsParasolsFansEarringsLocketsGlovesHandbags.Prairie dressesMidi dresses.Lace up bootsBootiesHeeled mules.Free PeopleMadewellMangoTargetNordstromH&MLaura AshleyGunne Sax (no longer in production)DÃ”ENChristy DawnMeadowsShabby Chic.Plaid patternCalicoDenim.Although this aesthetic has regained popularity since the late 2010's, it initially emerged in the 1970's. Much of the related media, usually television, is from the 1970's. Family shows like Little House on the Prairie, The Waltons, and some Western films are a part of it. The stories are in the same area, with the main characters growing older and learning about life while living through an 1800s era on a farm. .Genre(s): Blue Grass, Country and AmericanaEmmy-Lou HarrisFirst-Aid KitTrampled By TurtlesThe Civil WarsMumford and Sons (2009-2013)Taylor Swift - "Exile" (ft.
