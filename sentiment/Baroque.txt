Baroque is a term used to describe the predominant style of European architecture, music, and art of the 17th and 18th centuries. The term "Baroque" originated from the Portuguese word barroco, which means "misshapen pearl." Barroco was used first to criticize the overly ornate music of the Baroque era. It was later also applied to art, fashion, and architecture of the period, but eventually lost its pejorative tone.
