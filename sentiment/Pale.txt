Pale or Pale Aesthetic is an aesthetic based on simple photos with a color palette based on white, grey, black, green, and blue. Appeared on Tumblr between 2014 and 2015. Some photos are intended to be sad looking, of someone suffering for love or with a '90s vibe, for example.Despite calling themselves grunge, their aesthetic was fairly popular in the mainstream and connected to the rise of the Alternative, emo, pop, and indie music and fashion trends of the time, such as galaxy print, black and white grids, and fandom merchandise. Because of their close-knit community on tumblr, they developed a "not-like-other-girls" attitude, especially in contrast with the "hipsters" (which is more accurately described as an early version of VSCO). The type of media they consumed was also incredibly specific, with fangirl culture and this aesthetic often overlapping. This style later declined, yet has gained short-term popularity in 2020 due to a desire to escape to the past..This aesthetic can be described as very fresh or a clean variation of the grunge style. Enthusiasts of this aesthetic focus on taking pictures that contain:Band posters, cover art, and merchandiseBlack and white edits of movies and TV showsCigarettesConcrete edificationsFaceless photosGlassGreek statuesGuitarsJapanese kanjiLyrics and quotes in simple fonts over solid or gridded backgroundsOutfitsOld TVsPlantsPolaroidsSilver objectsSimple drawingsStorefrontsSucculents and cactiTechnology such as iPhones and headphonesVaporwave gifs done in black and whiteWhite roomsWater bottlesWriting and quotes. 	 	 	 		 			 		 		 		 			A basic look 		 	 The style associated with 2014-era tumblr has a very defined color palette in that it is typically monochrome or pastel, depending on personal preference. Japanese fashion, early 2000s emo, and more authentic grunge influenced the style, which has outfits that were incredibly specific, almost formulaic. Unlike grunge or the DIY ethos of other alternative fashions, these pieces were typically bought brand new at mall stores such as American Apparel and Hot Topic. Despite the term "tumblr girl" being the most popular term, men can wear the aesthetic too. Amusingly, these outfits are now associated with bisexuals, who likely used tumblr in their youth. Typical fashion pieces include:Band and fandom printed t-shirtsT-shirts printed with patterns popular at that time, such as galaxy, horizontal stripes, and black and white gridsPlain black and white t-shirtsFlannelsDenim jacketsCuffed jeansRipped jeansBlack skinny jeans (typically associated with the Hot Topic emo fans)Pleated tennis skirtsFishnet tightsKnee socksConverse sneakersCreepersCombat bootsVans shoes, often the black and white checksBlack plastic chokers and braceletsBeaniesFlower crowns.
