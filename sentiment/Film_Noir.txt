Its cynical characters, stark lighting, and existential philosophy are hallmarks of the style. The tropes often came about from the rise of "hard-boiled" crime fiction from the Great Depression, with the familiar tropes of urbanism, fast-paced slang, sex, and violence came into print, which contrasts the previous decade's country house mystery.    ..Alcohol, often hard liquorFogGuns, often revolversLarge cities with art deco skyscrapers and warehousesNightclubs, bars, gambling dens, and other hedonistic localesRainSmokingStreetlightsWindow blinds, creates a dramatic lighting effect.Private InvestigatorUndercover policemanAn average man, victim of circumstance (typically a Fall Guy)Corrupt Government OfficialsThe MafiaFemme Fatale.The music typically associated with film noir is 1940s-1950s jazz, often at a slow tempo, with a strong saxophone presence, and a feeling of melancholy and sensuality..Film noir | Jazz noir - Quiet dark jazz - Contemporary Post-bobJazz Noir • 1 Hour Jazz Noir Saxophone Music • Jazz Noir Music Playlist.For more, see the TVTropes index on the genre, as well as a list of one-off episodes in non-noir media. .Stranger on the Third Floor (1940)The Maltese Falcon (1941)Murder, My Sweet (1944)Double Indemnity (1944).
