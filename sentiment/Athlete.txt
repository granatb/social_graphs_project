The Athlete aesthetic is centered around sports and sportswear of any kind, whether it's worn for athletic competition or for supporting said sports team  .Although more of an activities-related aesthetic, the Athlete aesthetic can include visuals too. You may find brands, such as Nike, bringing their logos into aesthetic wallpapers, t-shirts, and phone cases.

The first is what's often referred to as "classic" or "golden era", which is a throwback to the golden era of bodybuilding (which contains individuals like Sergio Oliva and Arnold Schwarzeneggar) where, while size is important, it's not as important as having a very visually pleasing figure which can be attained by a variety of factors; the right genetics, the proper diet, the proper exercise routine, and, yes, drugs (though there are some who are referred to as "all-natural", meaning they forgo any drug usage and instead maintain a strict diet and exercise routine without having to rely on steroids or human growth hormones.  This philosophy has gotten so popular in recent years that the IFBB (the biggest governing body in bodybuilding) have set up a specific division for this bodybuilding philosophy called "Classic Physique".  Adherents to this philosophy include individuals like Breon Ansley and Chris Bumstead.The second philosophy is often referred to as "the mass monster", where it's about trying to get to be as freakishly big as possible, regardless if your figure is aesthetically pleasing or not (though there are some in this particular philosophy who do have at least mildly aesthetically pleasing bodies) who compete in what's known as "Men's Open".  Popular examples of bodybuilders who follow this philosophy include Dorian Yates, Phil Heath, Ronnie Coleman, Jay Cutler, Kai Greene, and Mamdouh "Big Ramy" Elssbiay.On top of these primary two philosophy, there are other forms of bodybuilding, including Men's Physique (usually the smaller of the bunch and not nearly as intensive as Classic Physique and Men's Open, though you still have to put in the work to maintain an aesthetically pleasing figure), 212 (which is the next step up from Men's Physique where you have to maintain a weight of at least 212 pounds to be eligible), as well as women's bodybuilding, which can be split up into Bikini, Figure, Fitness, and finally Women's Bodybuilding..
