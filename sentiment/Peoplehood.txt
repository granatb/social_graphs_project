(This article is under construction)Peoplehood is an aesthetic on tumblr (currently) that revolves around the mundane acts of kindness and intimacy that are present in daily lives shared with the people surrounding them. The community surrounding that aesthetic stems from a shared admiration for poetry, quotes from literature, music, and artworks that are circulated via reblogs on tumblr.
