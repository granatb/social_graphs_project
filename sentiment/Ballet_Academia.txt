Ballet Academia is an academic aesthetic that takes aspects from many different academias and focuses them on ballet and the ballet world. It takes the already-present romanticism of ballets themselves and gears it towards the academia culture..Ballet Academia activities are either learning about ballet or activities relating to it, such as:Learning some French so you can understand some of Ballet's specific words.Memorizing terminology, the translations, and the stepsObsessively stretching and strengthening while studying (doing homework in your splits)Knowing the plot points and characters of the major balletsLearning variations off of the internetListening to ballet soundtracks and being able to name them when they come up in mediaStarting taking ballet classes as an adult because you're never too old.Clothing for this aesthetic is elegant and graceful, and are usually dancing leotards or performance dresses..Black, white, and nude leotardsPastel coloured sundresses (preferable white or pink)Button blousesLong, elegant dressesWrap sweatersHalter necksBodysuits.Romantic length tutusBaggy leg warmers and warm up clothesBallerina skirts.Tights (pink and skin color)Ballet flatsTranslucent stockings.Flower crownsRibbonsBobby pins (to keep your hair in place)Small jewelry that won't get in the way (think small, whimsical earrings)Veils.TulleSheerFeathers..An American in Paris (1951)Ballet Shoes (2007)Barbie in the 12 Dancing Princesses (2006)Barbie in the Pink Shoes (2013)Black Swan (2010)Billy Elliot (2000)Bolshoi (2017)Suspiria (2018)The Red Shoes (1948).Dance Academy (2010-2013)Find Me in Paris (2018-2020).Tiny Pretty ThingsShiny Broken PiecesDancing in the DarkBallet Shoes.Princess Tutu.Swan LakeGiselleA Midsummer Night's DreamRomeo and JulietProfessionally filmed ballet performances..Aesthetic ♦︎ Dance Academia ♦︎ by Silverz
