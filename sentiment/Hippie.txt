Hippie (sometimes spelled as 'hippy') is a member of the counterculture of the 1960s, originally a youth movement that began in the United States and spread to other countries around the world. The word 'hippie' came from the word 'hipster' and was used to describe beatniks who moved into New York City's Greenwich Village and San Francisco's Haight-Ashbury district. While it faded out of fashion in the 1970s, it has enjoyed occasional blips of popularity since the 1990s. .For more information on the predominant part of the Hippie visuals, please check out the Psychedelica page, as the roots of Psychedelica are tied to early Hippie culture and still tie into the modern day Hippie aesthetic..Going to peaceful political protestsPlaying music togetherLearning about other culturesEating non-meat vegetablesMeditating, doing yoga or, otherwise, becoming more at peaceGardening/farming and supporting local agricultureGetting naked to connect to nature (sometimes).Hippie fashion may draw a lot of inspiration from the 1960s, but there are some modern hippie clothing vendors one can buy that range from tie dye clothing, to clothing with sacred geometry on it to Harem pants.
