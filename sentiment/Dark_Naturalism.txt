Dark Naturalism is an aesthetic that mixes in the natural world, with its more darker elements to create an atmosphere of a naturalist mystery..Dark Naturalism's visuals revolve around nature with a sense of obscure mystery. It interlocks with Dark Academia. Something like ghost and cryptid hunters, and mysterious forces in the woods. Handwritten threats with pressed or dried flowers, stained with a kiss of lipstick and sprayed with perfume or cologne; tied with a strip of ribbon, a blade of grass, or sealed with wax. Studying religious history and admiring its architecture, music and stories...Adrian von ZieglerBirdyBon IverDaughterEmma Ruth RundleGeorge EzraFoalsFlorence + the MachineHozierLana Del ReyLord HuronMumford & SonsOf Monsters and MenPeter GundryRag n' Bone ManRegina SpektorWoodkidEivÃ¸r PÃ¡lsdÃ³ttir.lost in the depth of a forestforest academiafloating in a dense forest in oregondrowning in the pinesMysticaldriving to cannon beachmainly coldplay - but gloomyðŸ”® Mystic ðŸ”® by Gaby Sena.Casually sharpening pencils with a pocket knifeReading nature poetry to the trees on campus as you lay under their shade.Leaving offerings for the fae and making risky deals with them to ensure your academic success.Studying by the open window of your house, feeling the breeze.Reading murder mysteries in a field of green grass.Leaving little bouquets as gifts to classmates and professors you hate.Doing a crazy amount of research on supernatural forces.Going out on little field trips to try and get a glimpse of the unknown.Respectfully loitering around churches.Waiting to catch a glimpse of the doberman.Learning and admiring culture.Majoring in horticulture.Finding and collecting bugs.Scooping up the spiders and crickets that get inside your school and taking the time to release them outside.Enjoying ghost anthropology and witchcraft.Disapearing into the woods for hours at a time.TightsLight, plaid skirtsMaroons, sage, greens and whitesButton downsDresses of all kindsTrousers either ankle length or rolledLightweight jacketsLinen shirtsFlowers with hidden meanings in your hair and clothes.
