Craftcore is themed around hand-crafted items. The most popular craftcore visual and activity is embroidery, but the aesthetic encompasses a variety of other craft activities and crafted items..Crafts have existed for a long time. However, the word "Craftcore" hasn't been used for this aesthetic until the late 2010s.In a society where most products are made by machines and robots, appreciating crafts and the craftsmanship that goes into it is something that has become lost on many members of society. Luckily, many people are still enjoying making and buying handmade items. Just like Cottagecore, Craftcore may be seen as an aesthetic that longs for simplicity and self-sustainability. However, Craftcore is not anti-tech. Using the newest tools for crafts is not looked down upon..Craftcore does not have a clear fashion guideline (it is very versatile and easy to combine with other aesthetics), although the following do fit the Craftcore aesthetic:(Self-)knitted sweatersAnything you've made yourselfThrifted clothing items that have been personalized by tailoring and/or embroideryOveralls that can hold all/most of your toolsPencil behind your earEmbroidering clothes you already have (most commonly insects (bees, butterflies, ladybugs), flowers/plants, stars/planets, animals (hedgehogs, deer, birds, foxes, cats, dogs), mushrooms, fruit, but also gaming and fandom-related patterns)Sturdy bootsCrocheted hats with flowers on themClothes that you added pockets ontoApronsPatchwork clothes (like jackets)Handpainted denimA totebag or satchel to hold your suppliesRibbons or hair ties (to keep your hair out of your face while you're working).Craftcore is centered around hobbies and activities.

Remember; quality over quantity.)Craftcore does not have to be expensive. Even though professional tools (such as a good sewing machine) are expensive, you can act this aesthetic out by, for example, just buying embroidery needles ($3-6) and yarn ($4-8) (maybe also embroidery hoops ($10-20)) to start embroidering your clothes..External links to help get a better understanding of this aesthetic.DIY JoyDIY Network.DIY Solutions for Easier Life | House Beautiful.
