Mod is a subculture that began in London in 1958 and spread throughout Great Britain and elsewhere, eventually influencing fashions and trends in other countries, and continues today on a smaller scale. Focused on music and fashion, the subculture has its roots in a small group of stylish London-based young men in the late 1950s who were termed modernists because they listened to modern jazz. Elements of the mod subculture include fashion (often tailor-made suits); music (including soul, rhythm and blues, ska, jazz, and freakbeat); and motor scooters (usually Lambretta or Vespa). The original mod scene was associated with amphetamine-fuelled all-night dancing at clubs..Mod revival was a music genre and subculture that started in England in 1978 and later spread to other countries (to a lesser degree). The mod revival's mainstream popularity was relatively short, although its influence lasted for decades. The mod revival post-dated a Teddy Boy revival, and mod revivalists sometimes clashed with Teddy Boy revivalists, skinhead revivalists, casuals, punks and rival gang members...Straight or A-line dresses worn above the knee in fabrics that hold their shapeGeometric shift dress (example: the Mondrian dress)Op Art printsBold, geometric patterns like British flags, polka-dots, and stripesMid-calf white go-go boots with pointed toes and flat heelsChelsea bootsMary JanesLow kitten heels and flatsPlastic-belted trench coatKnitted jersey mini-dresses with opaque and colorful tights"Wet look" PVC coatsSkinny-rib knitted sweaters in stripes or solid bright block colorsPatent-leather square-toed shoes and pilgrim shoes with bucklesBold white/blue/gray eye shadow applied all over the eyelidWhite/nude lipstick or lips painted over with pale matte foundationGroomed natural eyebrowsThick black winged eyeliner applied all the way around the eyeThick mascara or doll-like false eyelashesSheepskin coatsSuede/leather mini-coatsDresses with low-slung, wide loops to hold a hipster beltPlain or button-up A-line miniskirts worn with sandals in warmer months and knee-high boots in colder monthsTunic dresses worn over polo-neck sweatersAnkle-length bell-bottom trousersBeehive hair or short bob with bangs"Five point" Vidal Sassoon haircut: a short, angular five pointed pixie cut.Large plastic braceletsHuge round plastic earrings clipped on the earLucite rings with polka dotsBig or small boxy over-the-shoulder handbags in bright colors, or geometric designsClear/white painted almond-shaped nailsPeter Pan collars.Tailor-made three-button black/grey/brown suits with narrow lapels, vests, and pocket squaresThin tiesButton-down collar shirtsWool/cashmere jumpers (crewneck or V-neck)Chelsea or Beatle bootsClarks Desert lace-up bootsOxfordsLevis jeans, shrunk to fitSlim-fit chinos or tapered trousersEither a Fred Perry polo shirt or John Smedley knit polo shirt buttoned all the way to the topTurtleneckGreen/tan parka to protect your outfit while riding on your scooterNewsboy capsBrightly striped boating blazersHarrington jacketShaggy hair or a bowl haircutButtons from mod bands and British flag pinsRound glasses.Mary QuantCaroline CharlesMarion FoaleSally TuffinPaco RabanneAndré CourrègesRudi GernreichYves Saint LaurentPierre Cardin.B.A.I.T.
