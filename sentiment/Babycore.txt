Babycore involves "gentle", "pastel" or "cute" childlike innocence. This aesthetic leans toward softer, more Kawaii elements, and is distinguished from Kidcore through its usage of lighter colors and visuals typically reserved for babies and toddlers.  .There is a small but significant divide in the Babycore aesthetic community between soft, simple, very light-colored visuals, and plastic, cluttered, colorful visuals. These two sections of the community are not different enough to become their own unique aesthetics; they are united as a community by their shared values of childlikeness, innocence, and "cuteness", and visually by the use of pastels, infants' and children's items.PinkPlasticFrillsBaby soapsShampooBaby powderConditionerBody washLotionSippy cupsBottlesBand aidsBeadsCharmsStickersRibbonsBlanketsJewelry casesJewelry, especially children's jewelryChokersNecklacesBraceletsChildren's bags and backpacksFoods, especially dessertsCupcakesCakeIce creamCandy, especially very sweet, fruit-flavored candyCandy necklacesCotton candySugar sticksLollipopsChildren's toysStuffed animalsUnicornsElephantsBearsBunniesKittensDogsToy dinosaursSea animals, such as seals, penguins, and axolotlsPacifiersCharacters from children's TV shows and moviesHello KittyRilakkumaCare BearsSailor MoonMy Little PonyOnegai My MelodySanrioPuella Magi Madoka MagicaPersonality traits that can represent childlike behavior are as follows:ChildishSweetCrybabyEmotionalInnocent.Although some may choose to wear onesies and diapers, babycore does not necessarily focus on infant-like style.
