Pastel Academia is one of the many variations of the Academia aesthetic and subculture. It revolves around the ideals of having a passion for learning and studying, specifically the arts and literature. Someone who is a part of the Pastel Academia aesthetic is less mature and more child-like than those who identify with the other versions of academia. They enjoy venturing and have an overall upbeat and positive outlook on life, juxtaposing its less optimistic variations. Unlike its more well-known variations, Pastel Academia visually stems from a mixture of East Asian (mainly Japanese) and European cultures..Pastel Academia is another variation of the 'Academia' aesthetic. What makes Pastel Academia different from other Academia aesthetics is that it is very clear and easily identifiable. Pastel Academia focuses on having a passion for learning, exploring, and studying. Like other academias, Pastel Academia is about finding romanticism in education and learning new things. Unlike the more popular variation, Dark Academia, people who identify with Pastel Academia are more life-loving. They find happiness and peace in the little things like hanging out with a small group of friends or going to small cafés early in the morning, similar to people identifying with Light Academia. What makes them stand out the most, though, is their child-like and more immature personality than other variants. They are optimistic, hopelessly romantic, curiosity-driven, young-at-heart individuals. This is not to be associated with them infantilizing themselves (to be discussed later in more detail). Pastel Academia stands out when compared to other academia personalities(the elephant in the room, if you will).  	 	 	 		 			 		 		 		 	 .Pastel Academia visuals are heavily inspired by European and Japanese or East Asian cultures and the environment. For example, the architecture of European-style buildings, specifically universities like Oxford and places like Alnwick Castle, along with countryside and outskirt environments of Japanese provinces such as Chichibu, Shirakaba, and many more. However, if you live somewhere where there isn't much to explore, you're still encouraged to go out and explore places. Look for secret gems in the urban city and create your own homely Pastel Academia environment.     .Cute cafés and secret studying spots are also a huge part of Pastel Academia. Having a cozy space to study in and having cute supplies - like washi tape and personalized notebooks - are also part of Pastel Academia. Cute supplies are just supplies that are supposed to help people study more; this means that they don't have to be expensive. Pastel Academia isn't limited to people who can afford expensive school supplies..When they are procrastinating on their studies, pastel academics enjoy partaking in creative hobbies which help them calm down or play the role as a beacon of productivity and calmness. This can include journaling, painting, drawing, biking, knitting, crochet, playing an instrument, cooking, watching series and movies,editing, photography, and much  more..The following medias have some kind of relation to the pastel academia aesthetic, namely in visuality. If you don't enjoy many of these that does not exclude from the subculture by any means, be at peace and comfort with what you enjoy <3 .PonyoMy Neighbor TotoroKikki's Delivery ServiceOnly YesterdayThe Garden Of WordsHalWhisper Of The HeartYour NameThe Secret World Of ArriettyTamako Love StorySumikko Gurashi The Movie: The Unexpected Picture Book and the Secret ChildL'étranger de la PlageCinnamoroll: The Movie..Fairy TailHanayamataSailor MoonCardcaptor SakuraK-On!Quintessential QuintupletsLove Live: School Idol ProjectKinmozaIs The Order A Rabbit?Smile PrecureHyoukaOuran High School Host ClubKaichou Wa Maid-samaTeasing Master Takagi-sanAcchi KocchiYuyushikiLucky StarMewkledreamyKoisuru AsteroidFruits BasketMachikado MazokuHitoribocchi no OO SeikatsuSaint TailHugtto PrecureComic GirlsRilu Rilu FairiluLady JewelpetSlow StartGakuen BabysittersNyanko DaysNon Non BiyoriChi's Sweet HomeShugo Chara!Sansha SanyouMirmo ZibangToraDora!Pri ParaYumeiro PattisiereMomokuriHello Kitty ParadiseYuru YuriHanamaru YouchienMitsuboshi ColorsWakaba GirlTokyo Mew MewOnegai My MelodyRilakkuma TO KaoruUrawa no Usagi-chanMaple Twon MonogatariOre Monogatari!!Pita TenGakuen Utopia Manabi Straight!Kofuku GraffitiKamisama HajimemashitaTamako MarketJewelpet HappinessHidamari SketchOjamajo DoremiHinako NoteKaguya-sama: love is warNekopara.Angelina BallerinaMolangHello Kitty Super Cute AdventuresWe Bare BearsSummer Camp Island.Puella Magi Madoka MagicaK-12Scream QueensGakko GurashiGirl From NowherePrincess TutuMahou Shoujo Site.Love AlarmGirl's World..Pastel Girl : Dress Up GameNeko AtsumeLINE:Disney Tsum TsumSUMI SUMI : Matching PuzzleRilakkuma FarmMomo's DressupSumikkogurashi FarmPeter Rabbit -Hidden World-Rakko Ukabe - Let's call cute sea otters!Animal Crossing: Pocket CampLove Nikki-Dress UP QueenGenshin ImpactSKY.Animal Crossing: New HorizonsPokémonOuchi De Rilakkuma -Rilakkuma Ga Ouchi Ni Yattekita – Nintendo Switch Japan.Calico..anne of green gablesLittle WomenLittle PrincessThe Secret GardenDaddy Long-LegsWinnie the PoohThe Secrets of Divine Love.Hatsukoi*Rail TripCLAMP No KisekiKirari Books Meisouchu!Fushigi Neko No Kyuu-chanKiraKira★Study ~Zettai Goukaku Sengen~The Life After Retirement of Magical GirlsKitchen PrincessNanatsu Boshi Tea TimeKilala PrincessPixie PopBocchi the RockTsuki Ga Kirei Desu Ne.Odd Girl OutCat Loaf AdventuresTrue BeautyHEART AnthologyCursed Princess ClubYour Smile is a TrapSaphie The One-Eyed CatMy Kitty And Old DogThe Kiss BetChoco LatteAerial MagicSmile BrushSmall WorldStrawberry SeafoamAll That We Hope To Be..-Tapioca Milk Tea music video by Wasuta-To Heart music video by Fromis_9-Ah-Choo music video by Lovelyz-Glass Bead music video by Gfriend-Glass Shoes music video by Fromis_9-Navillera music video by Gfriend-Triangle Dreamer music video by Niji no Conquistador-WELCOME TO DREAM music video by wasuta for the anime "idol time pripara"-Secret Garden music video by Oh My Girl-Rough music video by Gfriend-Lisent To My World concert video by Oh My Girl-Conversation Fancy music video by Kamiyado-Cupid music video by Oh My Girl-PITAPAT (DKDK) music video by Fromis_9-Me Gustas Tu music video by Gfriend-What is Love? music video by Twice-Candy Jelly Love music video by Lovelyz-Tag Me music video by Weeekly-Dream Girls music video by I.O.I-Love & Live music video by Loona 1/3-Shani Muni Ikiru! video by wasuta-e905 music video by DIA-Heart Attack music video by chuu-Liar Liar music video by Oh My Girl-Hi High music video by Loona-MUAH! music video by April-Love Whisper music video by Gfriend-ON The Road music video by DIA -Wonderful love music video by Momoland-Allegro Cantabile music video by Nature-Haru Hanabi music video by WasutaIf you have any idea of other videos to put, feel free to oppose it..These are some fashion ideas for people who identify with Pastel Academia.

Slice of life anime is an excellent example of a genre that usually presents pastel academia ideals and values. TV shows and movies like Scream Queens and The Grand Budapest Hotel represent Pastel Academia as well, though from a more visual perspective. Again, you do not need to like or enjoy every single movie, TV show, anime, or piece of music that is mentioned. As long as you can appreciate and like the visuals of Pastel Academia as well as the values this subculture has to offer, you're good to go..Pastel Academia-style music involves lots of girl/boy bands, Lo-Fi, soft ballads, soft pop, and musical soundtracks from childhood movies. Pastel Academia is an inclusive subculture where academics don't or shouldn't care about what language the music they listen to is in, as long as it sounds okay..MitskiLana Del ReyMelanie MartinezLordeRainychBOL4SejeongAKMUL.DreHEIZEPorter RobinsonOwl CityDodieChevySnail's House.The two main aspects in almost every aesthetic is the ideals, personality and the visuals..Clearing Up MisconceptionsThere could be controversy in the future about this aesthetic being too "childish" to the point where people label it as infantilising. In no way shape or form is the intention of this aesthetic to attract or entertain pedophiles or imitate children. There is a huge difference between enjoying what society labels as 'childish' things and infantilising yourself to entertain adults. Pastel Academia stands for people who never or rarely got to experience being young, even if it's a time in their life they miss. Whether it's part of their personality or something that was developed throughout their life due to their environment, the innocence of this aesthetic is solely to give those people a safe space where they can express their love for studying arts, literature, and much more while standing up to people who tell them to "act their age" just because they are passionate about certain things like going on picnics, pastel colours and collecting things that make them happy. There is no place in this community for individuals who infantilize themselves for the pleasure of pedophiles, incels, and others.Respect & InclusivityThe Pastel Academia subculture is inclusive of people from all walks of life. Any race, gender, sexuality, and spirituality are welcomed here. People who marginalise and discriminate against other people are not welcomed in this subculture by any means. Respect is the number one ideology of this subculture. We do not associate with people who claim to be of this subculture but chose to harm and inflict any kind of disrespect onto others for any reason. We aren't immature in the sense that we act like children, but in our interests and hobbies. PersonalityAs mentioned before, the Pastel Academia aesthetic focuses on people who are more child-like at heart. They are usually optimists whose strength is that they often think creatively and outside of the box. This makes them academically suited for studies like literature and the arts. However, they don't have to be confined to just those subjects in particular.They love giving and occasionally craft gifts for their loved ones. In a relationship, they are caring and loving toward the other person/people.They are also quite spiritual despite their child-like tendencies. They are always searching for meanings to things due to their curiosity through religion or any other practice. This also drives them to philosophy..External links to help get a better understanding of this aesthetic..Deer DollAlyaboomty StoreJuwas FashionNothin Basic Hereyouvimiyihfoo store.Pastel Academia Spotify playlist by 走る オママPastel Academia Spotify playlist by MagicalGirlPastel Academia Spotify playlist by j.rascupastel academia Spotify playlist by cheryl!!.pastel academia by RunPastel Academia by Sophia CaliPastel Academia by Victory SunshinePastel Academia by winterbun_096Pastel Academia by Diego pinkberryspringcore/pastel academia by Felice!pastel academia  by mehAesthetic ♦︎ Pastel Academia ♦︎ by SilverzPastel Academia by KumanekoBaby.
