Princesscore is an aesthetic based on the life, fashion, and mannerisms of a princess. It is about the visual; looking like a princess, but also the behavior: being poised, educated and well-mannered, but most importantly, having all the qualities to take reign..As one may expect of an aesthetic so named, Princesscore fashion takes its inspiration from real royalty, especially princesses and queens, and fictional representations. The appearance of wealth and class distinction are quite important in this style..Originally pinned and draped pieces of fabricExpensive fabricsAbacaAgaveBurmese, Mulberry or other silkCashmereCottonGuanacoIndian woolLinenShahtooshVicu√±a WoolKnee-length tunicsAnkle-length robesKerchiefsFloor-length gownsLight, flowing dressesShawlsCorsetsNecklinesHigh-boned collarsSquare or roundV-neckSweetheartDeep and narrowRuffedOff the shoulderWith lace and/or embroideryIntricate patterns, often in primary colorsWedding gowns.AnkletsBanglesCrowns and diademsEarringsFansGlovesNecklacesParasolsRingsRich oils and perfumesSparkles.The atmosphere is strongly linked to the position of a princess, because it reflects the cultural traditions and various aspects of her life. Besides, this asks or answers various questions about her status and unknown future. Unlike the Queencore aesthetic, Princesscore usually doesn't make decisions or changes to the internal politics or the economy but is learning about it so that one day they can. It is worth noting that depending on the region where the princess comes from, the set of words linked to the position can change greatly.
