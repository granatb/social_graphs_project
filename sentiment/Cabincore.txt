Cabincore is an aesthetic that romanticizes the life of residing in a cabin. Similar to Cottagecore, Naturecore, and Adventurecore, Cabincore embraces the idea of getting away from bustling industrial life, favoring places where days can be spent in a more remote setting. The aesthetic features a rustic and snugly cabin theme..Since Cabincore is associated heavily with being snuggly, cozy clothes are a staple. .Cozy SweatersFlannelsWarm, thick coats.VestsJackets (denim, corduroy, down, etc.).JeansOverallsCorduroy Trousers.Warm socksSlippersHiking/work boots, timberlands, docs, suede boots, rainboots..WatchesThick BeltsSmall, plain jewelryCarabiners, multitoolsBeanies, brimmed hats, baseball capsGloves.WoolCorduroyLeatherDenimFlannelChunky Knits.BraidedMessy bunsCurlyPonytailsPretty much anything, especially if functional..Morning hot drinks on a foggy day.HikesBaking and CookingMushroom HuntingLighting a campfireWatching the sunrise and the sunsetStargazingGetting lost in the woodsSnowshoeing, skiing, snowboardingReadingRakingSpontaneous walksPlaying musicGrowing an herb gardenKnitting, crochetingEmbroidery while listening to your favorite musicRoasting s'moresTree climbingSitting and watching the world live..Over the Garden Wall (2014)Gravity Falls (2012-2016)Stand by Me (1986)Tuck Everlasting (2002)Peter and the Wolf (2006)Sweet Tooth (2021).Don't Call the Wolf (2020)Lord of the Rings (1954)The Chronicles of Narnia (1956)Harry Potter (1997-2007).Grown Ups (2010)A Walk in the Woods (2015)The Chronicles of Narnia (2005)Bears (2014)Harry Potter (2001-2011)Dreamcatcher (2003)The Kings of Summer (2013)Paddington 2016.Red Dead Redemption 2 (2018)The Last of Us Part II (2020)Life is Strange 2 (2018).Indie and Alternative Music, primarily falling under folk and rock subgenresThe Oh HellosHozierThe Paper KitesIron & WineCrying Day Care ChoirLord HuronCavetownThe Avett BrothersCaampFleet FoxesGregory Alan IsakovThe LumineersWatchhouse (Formerly know as Mandolin Orange)Punch BrothersNickel CreekMipsoBendigo FletcherHiss Golden MessengerFruit BatsPinegroveField Medic.LL BeanAmerican EagleThe North FaceREIScheels...Cabincore Pinterest Board.https://ourcottonwoodcreek.com/http://afterorangecounty.com/about/https://www.backwoodshome.com/https://www.thecabindiary.com/https://myselfreliance.com/blog/.Rustic Writing Vlog | living my best cabincore life: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubfX_wS9POoCabincore Tiktoks Compilation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA-Sepihp4ACabincore | aesthetic cores: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v.PLwsA0vr2fpObersrjwFKl69yQRDp88qGZ.Tea Party With Faeries- Jessie tea party with faeries but instead of tea it's peach soju by jessieCabin In The Mountains- Gretchen Mathiason: https://open.spotify.com/user/127940016/playlist/7bKvxhu9k7b3HIrd3s89c8Cabincore- deydd: https://open.spotify.com/user/deydd/playlist/7snSOqz8UkRAehymKWdK1IHoh Rainforest- Michael Matti: https://open.spotify.com/user/1285919/playlist/1FLMW5aIu3xhLdnlDESZLsTip Tap's PCT Playlist Keepers- kmkalan: Tip Tap's PCT Playlist Keepers â€“ kmkalan
