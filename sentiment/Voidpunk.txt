Voidpunk is a subculture among dehumanized groups that is normally described as the rejection of the human identity, and embracing being nonhuman. Both go along with applying those concepts to one's self, as a way of getting back at the dehumanization society has applied to them. While these are popular descriptors of the subculture, it is also up to the person's and community's personal perspective and experiences to describe Voidpunk. It is exclusively for groups and individuals who face dehumanization from society. Some groups included in that experience are a-spec people, nonbinary people, neurodivergent people, disabled people, and many more..Many voidpunk images use black, white, and cool tones like greens, blues, and purples, though yellows are sometimes found as well. Some followers of voidpunk create 'voidsonas', characters/designs that represent their experiences and personal concept of being voidpunk. Popular themes in voidsonas, as well as in general with the aesthetic, are space/aliens, robots/technological entities, glitching and distortion, mythological creatures/cryptids, extradimensionality, and the general feeling of something being Other. However, voidpunk has no one specific interpretation and is much more about how one approaches the concept through their own unique perspective and life experiences that allow them to identify with it..voidpunk(but the cool kind)voidpunk/inhumanisme[💎]Voidpunkhttp://suan.fm/mix/Bk34JyuPGEdgy Skinwalker GF by Lucy MorgensternVoidpunkvoidpunkÿ̴͉́̾e̸̢̹͖̱͔̊̌à̵̢̰̘͇ĥ̵̘̇̊͝͝ͅ./r/voidpunk on Reddit.
