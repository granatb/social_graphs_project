Anglocore involves the use of English-themed motifs to generate images with themes of patriotic and nationalistic sentiment for England and English ethno-culture. It has been seen as an expression of indigenous pride of the English people as any image perceived as inherently English falls under the Anglocore banner. It buys into the philosophy that the future of England rightfully belongs to the English people alone. .Anglocore visuals have a strong focus on the flag of St George and an overarching theme of English nationalism. Prominent colours include red and white, often alongside pink, purple or magenta hues. Images are often accompanied by patriotic quotes from figures such as William Shakespeare, Cecil Rhodes, Oswald Mosley and a variety of English monarchs and politicians. Anglocore may also focus on ideas of glory through classical architecture and war. While many Anglocore-esque images appear more wave-like, almost any image perceived as inherently English can be included under the Anglocore umbrella..Any music that provokes a sense of English patriotism, good examples include;God Save the QueenLand of Hope and Glory - Edward ElgarRule Britannia - Thomas ArneJerusalemRoots - Show of HandsOther Anglocore music might just be music that feels or sounds English - giving off an Anglocore vibe.
