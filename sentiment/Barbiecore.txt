Barbiecore is inspired by Mattel fashion doll Barbie. Barbiecore is the wholesome little sister to the more jaded, more adult Bubblegum Bitch. The aesthetic also includes "girly" 2000s television series like Lizzie McGuire and Hannah Montana, which focused on middle class American families. These shows encouraged confidence, female friendships, and girl power. Other products produced for tweens and teens in the early 2000s, like LipSmacker, are also part of the aesthetic.Imagery from a more upper class lifestyle created by the Barbie toy line and movies, which includes multiple cars, a private jet, huge house, multiple pets including horses, and a yacht, is also found in this aesthetic, especially when the items are pink..Fashion takes inspiration from the mainstream styles for girls and women in the late 1990s to early 2000s. With fashion inspired by specific Barbie movies, there can be crossover with Surf Crush, Equestrian, Fairycore, Princesscore, and Western aesthetics. The cutesy graphics can cause a crossover with Sanriocore or Unicorncore.
