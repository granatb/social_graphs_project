Fairytale is an instance of a folklore genre that takes the form of a short story. Such stories typically feature mythical, and often magical, entities, such as dwarfs, dragons, elves, fairies, giants, gnomes, goblins, griffins, mermaids, talking animals, trolls, unicorns, or witches, and usually magic or enchantments. In most cultures, there is no clear line separating myth from folk or fairy tale; all these together form the literature of preliterate societies. Fairy tales may be distinguished from other folk narratives such as legends (which generally involve belief in the veracity of the events described) and explicit moral tales, including beast fables.  ..Note that many of these stories have been adapted, and their original versions may not be as popular or influential as later retellings.
