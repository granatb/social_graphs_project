Essentially consisting of screencaps and gifs, Old Web is an aesthetic utilizing traditional web design elements combined with aspects of poetry and self-expression. This also includes GIFs, video games, and clip-art. This aesthetic expresses nostalgia for Internet culture of the mid-1990s to late 2000s (spanning roughly Windows 95 to the glory days of YouTube).Old Web's philosophical heart yearns for the days of uninhibited individualism of the old web, before the internet became streamlined and social media monopolized how people communicated, and web graphic design developed a stricter set of rules for the "dos" and "don'ts" for the sake of accessibility and marketing.Many Old Web screencaps and gifs come from archived Geocities websites made by amateur coders and animators. The limited nature of the internet contributed to old web graphics being a bit rough around the edges. Harsh website design choices, clunky animations, and pixel art are all defining traits of the old web aesthetic. Another main visual aesthetic that this category follows is the rounded blue edge windows that old software on Windows XP archived, the sharp looking windows that software appeared on Windows 95/98, or the transparent background that Windows Vista is much known for (in terms of looks).This may also include early 3D examples from Windows' screensavers or commercial, ads for any of Microsoft's product or even software that characterized the old Windows OS's.Cameron's World is a website put together to celebrate this aesthetic.

For those REALLY adventurous individuals in Old Web, there's always traveling the Deep Web, but be careful where you go on the Deep Web lest you stumble upon some potentially illegal content (though, to dispel the myths, no, not every website on the deep web is a hub for illegal pornography, hiring hitmen, and buying drugs, there are plenty of innocent sites on the Deep Web).
