Witch House is an aesthetic that originated with the music genre of the same name. It often (but not always) fits into the electronic sub-genre, and/or has themes that are dark and revolve around the occult, the supernatural, and horror..While Witch House definitely revolves more around music, it has been visually interpreted, taking a lot of cues from the Vaporwave school of aesthetic thought. It has been interpreted in three ways, which have sometimes been known to merge:Revolving around more tech-y visuals with dark undertones.Revolving around more actual witchcraft, in the sense of Pagan magick and/or Wicca.Revolving heavily around the dark aspect, often using imagery that may be found in horror.While there is a lot of crossover with the Witchcore aesthetic, make no mistake: Witchcore takes more of a nature-based approached compared to the more dark tech-y Witch House aesthetic, which can also invoke Satanic imagery on top of everything..Witch House fashion can draw upon a lot of Goth, Streetwear, Techwear, and Vaporwave fashions (although in the case of the Vaporwave inspirations, it's done less in the bright colors often associated with it and instead uses more of a monochromatic color palette with hints of red mixed in).  Witch House fashion can also draw upon a lot of 90s Grunge and Mallgoth fashion choices as well.Musically, Witch House has a droning, dark, and gothic sound to it that's designed to evoke a gothic atmosphere that works surprisingly well with the House music format.HumanfobiaDAZZLING MALICIOUSReberheadpowwowwModern WitchSidewalks & SkeletonsCrystal CastlesS4LEMWhite RingBLVCK CEILINGBLVCK CATâ–³Scoâ–³Fixionspurity ringIC3PEAKLightexRitualzâˆ†AIMON 	 	 	 			   	 	 		 			 		 		 			HOW TO MAKE WITCH HOUSE 		 		 	 .Witch House Spotify playlist by Sidewalks and Skeletonsâ–² â€  WITCH HOUSE â€  â–² Spotify playlist by eradielâœžâ–²âœž Witch House âœžâ–²âœž Spotify playlist by Lee CoxonWitch House Nights Official Spotify PlaylistWitch House Spotify playlist by Walther AngerWITCH HOUSE Spotify playlist by MrSuicideSheepThe Sound of Witch House Spotify playlist by The Sounds of SpotifyIntro to Witch HouseThe Pulse of Witch HouseThe Edge of Witch HouseA â™€Filter for Witch HouseRussian Witch House Spotify playlist by camrackamWitch House Spotify playlist by Victor HerreraðŸŽ® Gaming Dark Night ðŸŽ® by Gaby Sena.
