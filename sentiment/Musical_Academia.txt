Musical Academia is an aesthetic involving the art and education of music theory, culture, creation, and learning instruments and vocal techniques. These subjects coincide with Theatre Academia in the form of musicals. Musical Academia is not strictly adherent to school curriculum, as self-teaching may be just as effective and valid within the aesthetic. .Visuals for musical academia lie on a broad spectrum. This can include:Album coversBand/orchestra roomsBroken drumsticksCalloused fingersCDsConductors' batons and wandsCrumpled pages of compositionsDedication through tearsDried roses from old performancesEmpty band roomsFolders of sheet music stacked on shelvesGuitar picks, violin bows, reeds. drum gelsInstrument casesMetronomesMicromanaging before shows to make sure everything is perfectMicrophonesMusic books and music theory textbooksMusic education videosMusic standsMusical instruments of any kindMusic scores, clefs, and other notationOrchestra pitsOrganized percussion closetsPages of notes from judgesPencilsSheet musicShiny keys of a new marimbaStacks of totally not legal copies of sheet musicTunersTheaters/performance stagesVinyl.Musical Academia is open to interpretation, as it does not base itself on one genre of music. It can vary by culture and genre, as it is the education and knowledge of the music itself that is important to the aesthetic. Appreciation for all music is not necessary, as certain genres may be more appealing to an individual, in which case other music related aesthetics can be combined specifically for that person. For example, musical academia can be mixed with grunge to achieve an aesthetic similar to Kurt Cobain. .Music Academia can be applied to a variety of music genres as previously stated. Although, traditionally, certain genres and songs are commonly used for practicing instruments and are well known to music students. Each instrument, family, style, and genre has its own list of standards that everyone who considers themselves a musician of that type must, or at the very least should, know how to play. For this reason, it is nearly impossible to compose a list of songs that encompass all of musical academia. The list of standards for someone who plays jazz vibraphone versus someone who sings opera is going to be different and so on. However there are some standards that most musicians know, whether or not they intend to play them. Songs/pieces include (but are not limited to):Twinkle Twinkle Little StarHeart and Soul by Hoagy CarmichaelPorgy and Bess by George GershwinSummertime by George GershwinAve Maria by Franz SchubertThe Moonlight Sonata by Ludwig van BeethovenFur Elise by Ludwig van BeethovenClair De Lune by Claude DebussyBeau Soir by Claude DebussyPrelude and Fugue No. 1 in C Major by J.S.

Musical Academia can include anything from self taught musicians to band students and etc. Commonly associated with Musical Academia would be the fashion that one would wear to see or perform in a recital, concert, or other performance.
