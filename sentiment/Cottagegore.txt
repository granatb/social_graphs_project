Cottagegore (also known as Goth Cottagecore or Dark Cottagecore) is similar to Cottagecore, in the sense it has a strong focus on country life, baking, and vintage items, but contrary to its name, it instead includes darker aspects of nature (including rotten mushroom or plant aesthetics, forest cryptids, spirits or ghosts, and bones found in nature) as opposed to just taking the Cottagecore aesthetic and throwing a bunch of blood and gore on it.  It tends to also cross over with other dark aesthetics, like Dark Academia, Crowcore, and Vulture Culture..The things that differentiate Cottagegore from Cottagecore include:Rain and fogPoisonous plants and mushroomsThunderstormsThorn bushesCarnivorous plantsDark fairy talesTornadoesThere also tends to be less of an emphasis on the farming aspect that is often seen in regular Cottagecore and has more of a Witchy/Esoteric vibe to it, like a witch living out in the middle of the woods, cut off from civilization, and only relying on her coven of fellow witches to get by in the harsh elements of mother nature. Cottagegore has a reverence for mother nature as a force and an entity that can be incredibly destructive..Cottagegore tends to take the Cottagecore fashion aesthetic and runs it through more of a Gothic lens. The fashion consists of black flouncy dresses, black overalls, and old black clothing that can be worn while living a quiet, solitary farm life...Alias GraceRatchedThe Queens GambitA Series of Unfortunate EventsThe Haunting of Bly ManorOver The Garden Wall.Antrum (2018)The Cabin in the Woods (2011)Children of the Corn (1984)Eden Lake (2008)Evil Dead II (1987)The Farm (2018)Gretel & Hansel (2020)Hatchet (2006)It Comes at Night (2017)Mama (2013)Motel Hell (1980)Pan's Labyrinth (2006)Signs (2002)The Blair Witch Project (1999)The Forest (2016)The Ritual (2015)The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974)The Visit (2015)The Witch (2015)Wrong Turn (2021).The Girl From the Other Side..witchy cottagecore by sarahforest academia (dark cottagecore) by 🌳🌿🍄Dark Cottagecore🌲🧺🖤🌾🪐 by eden fawncottagegore (dark cottagecore) by Kester.Grandma's Catacombs by Grandma's CatacombsMoss Golem - The House That Grandma Built.𝖈𝖔𝖙𝖙𝖆𝖌𝖊𝖌𝖔𝖗𝖊 🥀🔪🍄 (dark cottagecore cassette mixtape)a cottagegore playlist for the shadows you encountered in the forest.
