Thank you.Stripcore is an aesthetic inspired by a romanticized vision of strip clubs and other such establishments. It is based around the idea of strip clubs and glow in the dark undergarments. The aesthetic glorifies the neon signage and back alley advertisements, as well as the glamorous interiors of these sorts of establishments.This aesthetic is often associated with a wide variety of musical styles, but in the modern era, Rap, R&B, Hip-Hop and Trap are most commonly associated with this aesthetic.  Because of the color palettes and similar motifs, Stripcore shares a lot in common with Synthwave, Vaporwave, and Glowwave, but with more of an adult spin than some of the aesthetics already feature..Stripcore is often based around the general contrast of neon lights on black or strip club backgrounds. Bright neon colors (such as: neon yellow, orange, red, pink, purple, and blue) commonly found on large strip club fronts are a noticeable aspect of Stripcore, as well as the back alley advertisement. Neon glowing glass usually found in strip club interiors is also a notable aspect of Stripcore.Items in the visual aspects of the Stripcore aesthetic can include:Neon strip signsPeep windowsStrip club interiorsBack alleysNeon strip advertisingStrip club exteriorsStripper polesThe Stripcore aesthetic may also include women performing within a strip club; something we will not be able to show on this Wiki for very obvious reasons.  As far as after hours go, the Stripcore aesthetic may have unfortunate crossovers into Drugcore territory (though it should be noted that this won't ALWAYS be the case with Stripcore; a lot of these ladies do like to keep it clean, after all, and are just doing their job)..Stripcore fashion is incredibly skimpy and can borrow heavily from both the Raver aesthetic (especially with the Raver festival wear that they'll often wear to outdoor festivals) and the Cosplay aesthetic (after all, these ladies are in the business of selling a fantasy).  In terms of make-up, a lot of Glowwave or even Chroma Chameleon can show up due to their inherently flashy and eye-catching nature, and what better way to catch the eye of customers than with flashy, eye-catching make-up and clothing.

Sometimes the music is about the boys going out to the strip club to spend lots of money on the girls or are sometimes just a glorification of strippers as a whole..Strip club music.Strip club 2020 ‚≠êÔ∏èStrip club anthemsStrip club music üçë.
