As described by Susan Sontag, the academic who codified the term, its characteristics are: "artifice, frivolity, na√Øve middle-class pretentiousness, and shocking excess". It is utilized in multiple mediums including film, fashion, theatre, music, and even modes of speech.

For example, Marilyn Monroe's white dress flaring up in the subway grates is not camp itself, but when another person mimics her actions in a highly exaggerated parody, it will be considered camp.
