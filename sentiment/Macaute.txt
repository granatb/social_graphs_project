Trigger warning: This article is not recommended for those sensitive to blood, guts, and other forms of violence. Macaute (pronounced Mah-cute) is an aesthetic coming from the word macabre, adjective "disturbing and horrifying because of involvement with or depiction of death and injury." and the word cute, adjective "attractive in a pretty or endearing way.".Examples of the macaute aesthetic would be graphic imagery like blood, guts and all sorts of gore (playing into the macabre part of the word) but depicted in a light, cartoonish way.  An artist who has made the Macaute aesthetic particularly popular is Jack Stauber, but possibly the earliest example of these aesthetic would be the classic Flash animation Happy Tree Friends..Macaute fashion may take a lot of inspiration from Kidcore or Scene fashion, but can mix it with some gory, bloody, or viscerally disturbing elements in order to achieve the jarring effect that Macaute strives to go for..Most media in macaute consists of artwork, music, etc but it can come in other forms as well.
