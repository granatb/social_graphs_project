Southern Gothic is a goth subgenre encompassing fashion inspired by Southern outfits, locations from the 1800s, and literary works. It originated in works by 19th-20th century Southern authors criticizing their society's racism, sexism, classism, fixation on the past, and decaying economy. Later the aesthetic deviated from literature with the "regional gothic" trend on tumblr in the mid-2010s, which places greater emphasis on Liminal Space, modern American iconography, evangelicalism, and controversially, hillbilly horror. Because of this, this entry is divided into two sections, with one based on the literary movement and the other on the tumblr revival. ..The visuals of the literary movement connect with the gothic imagery of decay as a metaphor for the fall of society due to lack of progress. Imagery tended to emphasize the political themes of the work and highlight the differences between the plantation class, poor white people, and black people.American Civil War imageryDaguerreotypesGhosts and other supernatural beingsPlantation houses in states of decaySouthern Belle-style dresses.Abandoned gas stationsAnimals with cultish undertones, such as deer and ramsBayous and swampsBillboards with evangelical messages meant to inspire fear in the readerGrotesque looking people.

Instrumentation tends to be acoustic, except electric guitar, and either in a slower tempo due to the singers' lower pitch and mournful theme, or in a rapid, scat-like approach to singing that is typically in more rock-like and rebellious songs. The lyrics address the common motifs of Southern Gothic: poverty, religion, drug addiction, the supernatural, and death. They often utilize tropes within novels and folktales, such as making deals with the Devil at the crossroads, witch trials, mothers mourning the death of their children, and becoming a killer. In playlists, there are exceptions, and multiple songs that carry across either an abandoned or a sublime, witch-like sound that do not suggest the American South are also popular. .Black Rebel Motorcycle ClubBlues SacarenoThe Brothers BrightThe Dead WeatherFire on FireJohnny CashRising AppalachiaRobert Johnson.https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPtD2znexvd2eabCPTSCpo-A2r8fvxk5f.
