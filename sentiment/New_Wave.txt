Wave is a broad music genre that encompasses numerous Pop-oriented styles from the late 1970s and the 1980s. The term derived from the unrelated "French New Wave" and was originally used as a catch-all for the music that emerged after Punk Rock, including punk itself, but may be viewed retrospectively as a less challenging counterpart of Post-Punk. Although new wave shared punk's DIY-philosophy, the artists were more influenced by the lighter strains of 1960s pop while opposed to mainstream "Corporate" rock, which they considered creatively stagnant, and the generally abrasive and political bents of punk rock. Common characteristics of new wave music include the use of synthesizers and electronic productions, and a distinctive visual style featured in music videos and fashion...Under Construction..Under Construction..Under Construction..Under Construction..Under Construction..See Synthwave for more information..See Vaporwave for more information.
