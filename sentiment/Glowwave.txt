Glowwave is an aesthetic surrounding the theme of things that glow in the dark or with assistance from a UV light (also commonly called a blacklight) or with the glow of neon lights and bright, neon colors. It is closely associated with raving or just good old-fashioned partying (similar to Cuddle Party), though it can have ties to the old Hippie culture..Glowwave aesthetics focus on things like glow sticks, lasers, and anything that either glows in the dark or is able to glow under a blacklight. It can also include things you can find in arcades, skating rinks, and raves and a lot of the psychedelic blacklight posters that were popular amongst the Hippie subculture of the 60s and 70s (and many stoners have in the modern-day)..Glowwave fashion consists of any clothing that can either glow in the dark or is reactive to blacklights (aka glows under blacklight), and accessories are anything that can light up. Glowwave hair and make-up can also be glow in the dark or blacklight-reactive as well.  Light-Up/Glow in the Dark things such as Backpacks, shoes, nail polish, t-shirts, pants, jewelry, etc. are often utilized as part of the Glowwave aesthetic.  It's about being as bright and vivid as possible.  Other elements can include:Bright, Vibrant colorsPastels (since some pastel colors can show up some in UV light)Glowing in the dark nails, makeup, backpacks, shoes, etcGlowstick accessoriesBaggy/vibrant shirtBright HeadbandsBrightly-color shoes or bootsBrightly-Colored Hair that's been dyed with UV-reactive colors.RavesLaser TagArcadesBlack Light BowlingBlack Light Miniature GolfRoller SkatingDrawing with UV-reactive substances (paint, crayons, markers, pencils etc.).While there aren't any known examples of Glowwave music, adherents to the Glowwave aesthetic may listen to EDM, Lo-Fi, Synthwave, Vaporwave, Acidwave, Psychedelica, Chiptune, and possibly some Madchester. If you can dance to it or just vibe to it, it has a place in the Glowwave library...Arcadecore is a particular subgenre of Glowwave with a heavy focus on how it felt to be a kid in the 80's or 90's, running around an arcade; something of a crossroads between Vaporwave and Kidcore. This aesthetic includes cheap plastic toys, neon signs, pizza, arcade games like Donkey Kong and Pac-Man, the patterns on the carpet floor, etc.  It can also draw a lot of heavy influence from arcades of the 80's and 90's, which can include a lot of neon colors, arcade cabinets, ticket booths, arcade tokens, etc. Arcade pizzerias that were popular in the time like Showbiz Pizza, Chuck E. Cheese, and businesses of that nature (which can lead to a lot of crossover with the Five Nights At Freddy's franchise) are another influence.  The fashion is generally pretty low-key; a simple pair of jeans/shorts/skirt, t-shirts or hoodies centered around retro arcade games and retro-themed kids products, cheap plastic costume jewelry, simple sneakers (or light-up ones if you feel like getting fancy), it's not an overly flashy aesthetic fashion-wise, considering what it's source material is, though that isn't to say that this couldn't change in the future..External links to help get a better understanding of this aesthetic..MoodHoopsManic PanicIroiroUniqsoMoon CreationsStardust LEDsRune RefineryVolga VerdiUFOMonkey BunnySpace TribeStonebrook JewelryChemi-OnTempest RingsGloFXBeWildPublic BetaEtere (if you have the money for it...)My Secret WoodsCarbonFiKikwearUltraPoiPatrick Adair DesignsTetramodeYour Mind Your WorldElectric StylesGlow CityCyberdogInner Art WorldInlightenAll-Over Shirts by LumiFuturistic Lights.arcadecore Spotify playlist by victoria.foss-usarcadecore Spotify playlist by Aster Van Alboomarcadecore || future bass mix Spotify playlist by missmusicallymadhatter.
