Northerness is an aesthetic related to Nordic/Scandinavian areas of the world. Those who follow this aesthetic    have the goal of living in the north in a remote location; going back to the ancient pagan roots of Europe and a conservation of the wilderness and the old ways.  Some members of white nationalist movements have attempted to co-opt these symbols to promote their own hateful ideology, but the Northerness aesthetic has absolutely no interest in promoting a white nationalist ideology and would instead like to reclaim those symbols as sacred to the Nordic people as opposed to something used to promote hate (especially considering, for their time, the Viking people were actually an incredibly progressive society).   .The Northerness aesthetic is usually associated with the Nordic/Scandinavian countries, deep woodlands, Northern Lights, small red houses, and ancient pagan rites.  It can also include the hygge atmosphere. Its clothing and interior styles are calm and muted. Things like jumpers, woolen socks, warm white light, and birch wood are all core parts of the aesthetic, along with a connection to nature and friluftsliv. Unlike some aspects of modern Nordic fashion, Northerness fashion doesn't have to be modern and super minimalist. It can look dated..Warm, cozy, and comfortable clothes are important in Northerness (due to the Scandinavian countries being so far north).
