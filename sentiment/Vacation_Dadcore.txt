Vacation Dadcore is a style aesthetic focusing on Hawaiian prints, socks and sandals, wide-brim hats, tan lines and that relaxing vacation lifestyle. The aesthetic stems from the low effort, comfortable but also practical style commonly worn by dads on holiday. Each dad is different and thus the aesthetic is diverse; polo shirts, button-downs or even vests are all well within the Vacation Dadcore aesthetic, as it only truly is Vacation Dadcore if you don't really care what you're wearing and just want to get a tan..The Vacation Dadcore was inspired from the Miami beach movement circa 1974, and as a result, most of its imagery is stolen from this era; a time of handlebar moustaches and glorious shirts.The '70s kids that didn't let this style die brought socks and sandals to the scene for the '90s, beige-en-ing the palette whilst keeping the style of the flower necklaces and aviators.Popular imagery associated with Vacation Dadcore includes blue oceans, wide sandy beaches, little huts selling booze at like 10 am. Palm trees and cruise-liners in the distance. Hawaiian shirts, distinct tan lines paired with bushy moustaches, and late-night bowling alleys.Other popular Vacation Dadcore vibes include:1970s - 80s MiamiMiami ViceMagnum, P.I.Vibrant ColorsNeon LightsGold ChainsHawaiian shirtsPoolsidesHotline Miami.
