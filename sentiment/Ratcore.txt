[DISCLAIMER: this article is not a joke. this is a real aesthetic that some people enjoy, thank you.] Originating on social media apps like Tumblr and Instagram in the late 2010s , Ratcore tends to intersect with other aesthetics such as Goblincore, Pigeoncore and Bastardcore. Many Ratcore photos are of people's pet rats or edited stock photos. Ratcore tends to have a "creepy-cute" aspect to it. This especially is prominent when visuals have soft colors, cute imagery, glitter, etc, as throughout history rats have been associated with disease, filth, and death. Sometimes Ratcore is portrayed as having a very chaotic aspect to it because of the "rabidness" and wilderness of the small animal. . 	 	 	 		 		 		 			"Rato Dorime" 		 	 Ratcore is often associated with memes and reaction images. Though the aesthetic's followers and participants are rat enthusiasts, the aesthetic does often have a tongue in cheek element.
