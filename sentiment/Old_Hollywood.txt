Old Hollywood is an aesthetic surrounding the movies, music, and fashion of the 1930's- 1960's. It's meant to draw you into a time before and forget about the current things happening, back into a time where everything felt simpler. It's important to note, however, that this time period was riddled with bigotry, and not actually as idyllic as the media of the time presents.  .The Old Hollywood period was the beginning of the Sound Era: when silent movies faded out of the spotlight as we transitioned to sound-film production. The beginning of the Sound Era isn't exactly set in concrete. Some think of it as when the movie The Jazz Singer was released in 1927, which was the first full movie with synchronized dialogue (though I don't recommend watching it because it's highkey racist), while some see it as 1929, the official end of the Silent Era. Old Hollywood movies adhered to strict set of genres: Western, comedic, musical, and biography, sometimes multiple at once. The movies have linear timelines that leave no room for speculation, except when a character has a flashback, and the problems are always solved at the end (one of the reasons people are drawn to this aesthetic). ..Fashion from the old Hollywood days include:Midi length dresses, large collars, puff sleeves, belted waistsA long evening gown, backless, deep cut, sleevelessHigh waisted sailor pantsSlouch hats, tilt hats, knit beretsPillbox hatsFur boas and jacketsOxford ShoesT-strap and Mary Jane heelsKitten heelsPearl earringsSmall handbagsOpera glovesMakeup was minimal but bold, dark lips and thin eyebrows were popular.You can get pieces like these from vintage/thrift stores, there are also lots of sewing patterns on Etsy..Lots of wavesShorter hair is ideal, but you can still have lots of hair-do's with longer hair.Classic finger curls are an amazing look.You can find lots of inspiration from actors at the time...Greta GarboRudolph ValentinoColleen MooreNorma ShearerJohn BarrymoreLon Chaney, Sr.Joan CrawfordGloria SwansonGinger RogersBarbara StanwyckFred AstaireVivien LeighErrol FlynnClark GableShirley TempleOlivia de HavillandJudy GarlandJean HarlowFay WrayMarlene DietrichBette DavisKatherine HepburnMickey Rooney.James StewartLauren BacallLaurence OlivierCary GrantHumphrey BogartVeronica LakeAva GardnerHenry FondaLana TurnerGary CooperRita HayworthGene TierneyHedy LamarBob HopeIngrid BergmanBing CrosbyRobert MitchumBurt LancasterWilliam HoldenJohn Wayne.Elizabeth TaylorMarilyn MonroeElvis PresleyGrace KellyMarlon BrandoRock HudsonDorothy DandridgeRuby DeeAudrey HepburnJames DeanShirley MacLaineDebbie ReynoldsLucille BallJeanne CrainSophia LorenNatalie WoodCharlton Heston.Here are some of the classic movies from this time period.The Wizard of Oz (1939)Gone with the Wind (1939)King Kong (1933)The Adventures of Robin Hood (1938)Frankenstein (1931)Dracula (1931)Snow White (1937)Singin' in the Rain (1952)There are also many later movies, set in or pay homage to the era:Sunset Boulevard (1951)Cats Don't Dance (1997)Silent Movie (1976)Singin' In The Rain (1952)The Artist (2011)Myra Breckinridge (1970).-Hollywood, Ryan Murphy (2020) (about a group of aspiring actors and filmmakers during the Hollywood Golden Age in the post-World War II era).Under Construction.
