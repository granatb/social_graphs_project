This is a sensitive topic and the controversy is discussed in depth at the bottom of the article. Many would argue that buying into this aesthetic and subculture is not far from a romanticization of pedophilia. Please research the implications of this style thoroughly before making the decision to involve yourself in it. If this makes you incredibly uncomfortable but you do like the look, you can still be a part of the Babygirl community and frown upon people in the community who do romanticize pedophilia.It's still necessary to acknowledge even harmful influences on modern visual culture, but we at the Aesthetics Wiki DO NOT condone the romanticization of pedophilia. Continue at your own risk.Babygirl is an aesthetic taken from the BDSM subgenre of the same name. Babygirl encompasses sweet and innocent imagery and attitudes that give the adult wearer an overall childlike feel. The Babygirl aesthetic can vary from Babycore to Baddie to E-Girl or Pastel Goth. Often this can cross over with bratty attitudes and behavior; this means the sweet and submissive nature can morph into teasing, pouting, tantrums, entitlement, and a compulsion to challenge others. These childish themes allow the person to release typical adult stressors and fall into a more easy and comfortable state of mind as a stress relief technique sometimes known as age regression. Although, this aspect in its depth is not required or utilized by all in the community and is reliant on individual preference. The main purpose of this aesthetic, seperate from the sexualized sect, is to allow adults to feel and reclaim childhood wonderment and comfort, and to also overcome obstacles from abuse (similar to Traumacore's purpose) and heal while still maintaining a more matured sense of style and dignity. Be advised when searching terms related to this aesthetic as the results will show explicit content aimed at adults 18+.      .Visuals for babygirls lie on a vast spectrum under the cute, feminine umbrella.

This role-play dynamic is not uncommon and quite popular among some internet subcultures. The titles/terms are even used in relationships outside if the genre, as they originated sometime in the 1950's as pet names for couples. However, a large population believes that this aesthetic goes too far by sexualizing innocence, father-daughter relationships, and behavior common in children. This can create a dangerous scenario similar to that of the Nymphet aesthetic, wherein underage girls may perpetuate this sexualization and/or become victims of it. Often times, this community is lumped in with "MAPs" (minor-attracted persons aka pedophiles) and is often demanded by users on social media sites like Tumblr to not view their individual content. The existence of this aesthetic in tandem with DDLG can increase the predation and acceptance of predation on young girls, which can only be stopped by the intelligent, careful, and watchful eyes of the community. The vast majority of babygirls and members of the community are aware of the connotations associated with it and are the first to speak against its links. The DDLG community itself outright denounces all pedophilic notions and associations, and is swift to reject and condemn those who partake in such atrocities. The community prides itself in maintaining the standard of consensual, legal roleplay between sane adults in a safe environment. The purpose behind the DDLG community is described as "...exploring and enjoying the headspace of a younger person. It’s about experiencing the world through new eyes and enjoying a relationship in a different way" and doesn't always include sex. There are some who "use it to reclaim childhood abuse or neglect and get to experience the "ideal" childhood they missed out on in a safe environment with people they can trust." Some say it can be freeing to allow another person take care of you as if you are younger, it can allow someone to express themselves in their own true way, and can strengthen a loving relationship with their partner through a trusted power exchange. The babygirl aesthetic derives its philosophy from these ideals of trust, freedom, individuality, and healing. Many may use the aesthetic for visuals' and fashions' sake alone, choosing to reject the sexual notions of DDLG, as the other aspects of the aesthetic are enough to draw attention and attraction. It is valid to enjoy the visuals, cute fashions, and personalities of this aesthetic without fully engaging with the extended community. If you choose to adopt this aesthetic, it is imperative to understand the connotations and perceptions that come with it. If you still like the style but do not want to be involved due to the controversy or are not of adult age, alternatives to this aesthetic include Babycore, Baddie, E-Girl, Lil Girl, Pastel Goth, Sanriocore, or Softie.
