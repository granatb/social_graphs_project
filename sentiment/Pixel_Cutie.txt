Pixel Cutie is an aesthetic based on a fascination of pixel art and games, usually involving cute, light colors like (but not limited to) Pink, Lilac, Light Blue, Soft Orange, etc.. Sometimes it can also associate with 8-bit clouds and sunsets, but not always. Pixel Cutie has a somewhat childish aspect..Pixel Cutie is based on 8-bit art and digital art. There are usually fun, light, beautiful colors. Other pleasing art that fits this aesthetic can be clouds, sunsets, anime/chibi, animals, etc.  Unlike aesthetics such as Lo-Fi (which tend to promote a more chilled-out, laid-back vibe) or Milleniwave (which utilizes bright, happy colors to poorly mask existential dread), Pixel Cutie tends to go for more of a bouncy, fun, happy-go-lucky look that instills a sense of child-like glee..Clothing that fits the Pixel Cutie aesthetic can include:Brightly colored t-shirtsTie-dyeTees with fan-art from video gamesLight colored jeans/jean shortsBright colored sneakersLight-colored hair-ties, scrunchies, or bracelets on wristsAnything related to art or gamingIn a lot of ways, Pixel Cutie fashion can cross into the sorts of fashions often associated with something like Vaporwave and Seapunk (although with less sarcasm and cynicism that is often associated with Vaporwave and less of an aquatic vibe that is often associated with Seapunk)...Music that fits the Pixel Cutie aesthetic is usually 8-bit or synthesizer. It often doesn't have words.  Snail's House is a very popular example of an artist that makes music that (not specifically, more coincidentally) would fit this aesthetic.  Other popular genres can touch into Pixel Cutie territory include Vocaloid music, the more chiptune-y side of Synthwave, Video Game music, and even some Hyperpop.Some artists include:AnamanaguchiMoe ShopOresamaReolShawn WasabiSnail's HouseStudio Killers.UndertalePokemonAnimal CrossingDoki Doki Literature ClubPony IslandAny old video gameOmori.Some drinks that fit the aesthetic:Any sort of LemonadeAny sort of juiceBoba/Bubble TeaSeltzerCider.
