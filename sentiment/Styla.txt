Styla is a subculture based out of Western Europe with many of its adherents being of Turkish origin. They are often seen as the Western European answer to the Guido subculture in the Northeastern United States (specifically around the New York City/New Jersey area)..Some of the fashion elements in Styla fashion include:Dark or mirrored aviator sunglassesBaby-pink shirts or sweatersHuge earrings of diamonds or other gemsShirts or sweaters with strass applications and/or counterfeit designer label printsWhite shoes out of patent leatherHeavily bleached jeans or white pantsbandannas, worn cowboy styleTrucker caps resting gently on their headsOverly gelled hair, often with a bleached Mohawk (which has drawn some comparisons to Scene Kids)Shaved back head with tribal patternsFake tan (if not of Turkish descent themselves)Pants tucked into white socks while wearing Nike AirMax or Lacoste shoesAsian letter tattoos.Much like the Guidos, Stylas subscribe to the same "fake it til you make it" philosophy that they subscribe to. Unlike the Guidos, however, Stylas tend to favor gangsta rap and R&B as opposed to House music.
