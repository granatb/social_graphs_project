Romantic Academia is an academic aesthetic specializing in love, romance literature, and the Romantic era. Romantic Academia is visually and philosophically similar to Light Academia. However, Romantic Academia includes more visuals associated with romantic love and lust, the latter of which is generally excluded from Light Academia. Philosophically, both aesthetics value education, curiosity, compassion, and optimism, but Romantic Academia differs from Light Academia in its focus on individualism, appreciation of nature, and aesthetic expression of intense and sometimes negative emotions. Like both Dark and Light Academia, Romantic Academia relies heavily on visuals, philosophy, and literature with origins in Western Europe.  .Romantic Academia combines the love of learning and literature with the values of Romanticism, including individuality, emotion, celebration of beauty and nature, and rejection of social convention. It is also partially influenced by the values of Dark and Light Academia. One of the other most important themes is that of exploration, the urge to discover. These ideas stem from the romantic appreciation of nature and the academic goal of studying, although it dispels the idea of studying as an immobile task. This aesthetic defines studying and learning as something that can be witnessed firsthand, not just from documents but also from the application in the real world.
