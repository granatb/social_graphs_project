Viewer discretion is advised.Morute, a name combining the words "morbid" and "cute," is an aesthetic created in the early 2010's that expresses the dichotomy between a hyper-feminine and childlike softness with grunge and Gothic elements. It is an outlet for expressing trauma, especially those surrounding eating disorders and mental illness. Many visuals also suggest physical abuse, sexual assault or precociousness, self-destruction, and physical disability. The child-like imagery serves as a desire to return to a girlhood that was ripped away from them, with the Christian and cute motifs being an idealization of purity and innocence. Religious guilt is a common motif, with the desire to go to Heaven, but feeling unable due to the victim being "dirtied" with whatever traumatized them. Poverty within small-town Americana is also present, and it reflects the influence of horror movies and the idea of home being sullied and unsafe. The common character trope of being a victim of a serial killer that is herself morbid and evil is possibly a representation of the cycle of trauma.   It is a precursor to Traumacore, and that aesthetic is an example of convergent evolution, wherein two aesthetics express the same thing, but the later community is relatively unaware of its predecessor and its influences. The aesthetic is one that has largely fallen out of popularity due to the current notoriety of Traumacore, the insular community, mental recovery of many influencers, and discourse surrounding the aestheticization of dark themes. The community itself does not emphasize the necessity of actually having trauma. Many simply are visually attracted to it and there is no need to discuss or vent about past experiences. ..See Kinderwhore for more information. .Cult Party Kei, a fashion characterized by its use of pastel, diaphanous vintage garments such as bed jackets, night gowns, and layered skirts, as well as its use of rosaries and red medical crosses, gained popularity in 2012 Tumblr. These elements are seen in Morute fashion, albeit in a more simplistic and less layered coordination. .Nicole Dollanganger is a Canadian singer-songwriter whose music and visual presence on tumblr greatly influenced, and arguably created, the Morute aesthetic. Her stage name itself, Dollanganger, was taken from the Gothic novel Flowers in the Attic, which explores poverty, abuse, incest, and religious fear, which are multiple motifs that appear in her songs and later Morute artworks. In 2011, she released her first song, Coma Baby, on tumblr to great praise. Her music is characterized by her ethereal, child-like voice contrasting with lyrics about kink, violence, and depression, something that is both influenced and admired by metal and hardcore musicians. 	 	 	 		 		 		 			Watercolor on a doily by Nicole Dollanganger 		 	 Her now deleted aesthetic, personal, and self-promotional blog on tumblr contained multiple visuals associated with Morute: bondage, horror movie stills, 1920s porcelain dolls (which she collects), and her own hand-drawn illustrations.

Her style ranges from hazy and whitewashed to found footage-esque. Her photo subjects include gloomy scenes of her small suburban town, herself wearing girly J-fashion and vintage nightwear, and small trinkets often found in the Morute aesthetic. Many images typically circulated in the Morute community are hers, and she has also influenced other aesthetic communities such as Suburban Gothic, Vintage Parisian, and Kawaii. She deactivated in 2014, but a fan blog has archived most of her photography here.  The tumblr purge, done in December 2018 caused multiple tumblr users to lose their accounts. Morute fans often reblogged images that would be against the new ban on adult content, such as images that referenced BDSM and the Nymphet community. Because of this purge, many accounts are now lost. Some dedicated users have rebuilt their old blogs, which explains why multiple users do not have content before 2018, despite their previous content on the site. Images from deleted accounts are still lost, such as those from the blogs deleted in 2014, .This page is under construction.The visuals of Morute rely on the juxtaposition between sweetness and death. The most popular and recognizable images are typically macabre subjects framed with a cute background, such as a knife on a pink bedsheet.

As such, the music of Morute is largely defined by her. The non-Dollanganger artists included here are ones that appear in 8tracks playlists (see 2014-era tumblr for an explanation) and have a similar sound, but may not necessarily be as popular within the community. In addition, grunge and metal bands with lyrics that express the same vulnerability and sexuality as Morute are included. .Cake Bake BettyElvis DepressedlyNicole Dollanganger.HoleMarilyn Manson.External links to help get a better understanding of this aesthetic..Slouchybear on Etsy..
