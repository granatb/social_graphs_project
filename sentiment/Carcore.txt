The 80's in particular has led to a lot of Carcore imagery turning up in Synthwave images (popular cars including the DMC DeLorean and the Lamborghini Countach). Influence from the 90's often focuses on Japanese sports cars of the era. It is typically associated with hashiriya, illegal street racers in Japan who pushed their tuned sports cars to the limits across expressways and tōge (narrow winding mountainside roads). This would popularized by anime and manga such as Wangan Midnight and Initial D as well as video games such as the Tokyo Xtreme Racer series. .While a lot of modern cars (on stock), tend to be less on the aesthetically pleasing side and focus more on functionality, modern sports cars continue the trend of being not only incredibly fast, but also very aesthetically pleasing designs..A unique subsect of Carcore can draw focus on car concepts planned for the future, which can either be an indication on where the future of automobiles can go to or where the past of the time thought automobiles were going to go (even if the ideas didn't quite pan out the way they had intended)..A lot of cars can take on very unique paint jobs, popular among these being color-shifting paintjobs and itasha; cars decked out with paintjobs inspired by anime. Videos of color-shifting cars can be very popular on YouTube and Instagram..Dekotora or decotora (デコトラ dekotora), an abbreviation for "decoration truck", are extravagantly decorated trucks in Japan.
