Yume Kawaii (ゆめかわいい) is a Japanese aesthetic that refers to pastel, fairytale, fantasy-like things. It appears like the embodiment of a “girls dream” and you can find many illustrations, clothing, and goods, which incorporate this. Due to the nature of dreams, it can also feature nightmarish elements.. 	 	 	 			   	 	 		 			 		 		 			Genres of Kawaii- Yumekawaii 		 		 	 Yume Kawaii fashion includes feathers, frills, ribbons, and other fluffy materials in its looks. The outfits usually consist of printed tops with a sailor collar, sheer jackets, poofy skirts or pants, loose socks, and platform shoes. Sleeping mask headdresses and pillow bags are also popular.  While Fairy Kei emits a vintage, retro kind of kawaii, Yume Kawaii also covers many modern styles and features lots of motifs related to Japanese pop culture, such as magical girls, strawberry milk, and conpeitou. The hair is often bleached and dyed to archive high tones like milk tea, pastel pink, and lavender, but wigs in fluffy styles are also very common. There are many circle lenses, glitter under the eyes, and very pop impressions. And there is an important element: the "sleepy" look. People achieve this look by applying an excessive amount of blush under their eyes. .Yume Kawaii may have fairytale and cutesy motifs, but it also consists of nightmarish themes. And just like this style, there are photo and image edits that embody this pale cuteness and slightly sad poems. There are Yume Kawaii illustrations as well. One of the most well-known illustrators who represents Yume Kawaii is Kato Rei. He has released his first artbook, "Girl Friend" in 2015. It characterizes Yume Kawaii with its use of pale colors and romantic girly appeal. .Popular idol groups within Yume Kawaii include:Candye♡SyrupCY8ERIce Cream Yume ShoujoSenananStrawberry SyndromeYunomi.External links to help get a better understanding of this aesthetic..Yumeholic.ConpeitouLara LovelyMiracle.comNijiiro PonicSwimmer.DREAMWAVE - OFFICIAL PLAYLIST (UPDATED) by DreamwaveDreamwave Spotify playlist by jokerfilDREAMWAVE Spotify playlist by fe.izaYume Kawaii💫🌨 Spotify playlist by 22rb23s2mdl4dtfdxqtroqtgi🍭🤡When you wanna put stickers on your face🍫🐇 by PholantasiaDreamwave Spotify playlist by JNastyDreamwave Spotify playlist by Rowan Easter.Yume Kawaii by YumelixirYume Kawaii by valentin.
