Modernism was a movement that encompassed philosophy, art, architecture, literature, and music. It lasted from 1910 to 1939, though it appeared to begin in the 1870s and more accurately ended in 1945, after the atomic bomb was dropped. This led to Postmodernism.Modernism was a rejection of tradition and the Enlightenment values that had once consumed Europe. People started to feel like ideologies (religious and moral) and culture were falling apart, which went against Enlightenment ideals; Modernism embraced this fragmentation of culture. This means that Modernism can also be seen as a state of mind that continues to this day..In art, Modernism does not represent one particular style. It valued a rejection of traditional techniques. Modernism in art meant experimenting, which led to the  use of new styles, materials, and techniques.Art movements that are a part of Modernism include Impressionism, Expressionism, Fauvism, and Cubism..George AultCarlos Quizpez AsínHélène de BeauvoirGeorges BraquePatrick BrucePaul CézanneFrancis CrissStuart DavisAndré DerainRobert DelaunayArthur DoveMarcel DuchampHenri le FauconnierSuzy FrelinghuysenRoger de La FresnayeEl GrecoAlbert GleizesJuan GrisJavad HamidiMarsden HartleyJoy HesterSteven HirschWassily KandinskyYervand KocharFernand LegerÉdouard ManetJohn MarinHenri MatisseJean MetzingerClaude MonetEdvard MunchElie NadelmanGeorgia O'KeeffePablo PicassoPierre-Auguste RenoirParitosh SenCharles SheelerJoseph StellaHeitor Villa-Lobos."Form follows function" was a saying that best represented modernism in architecture. This meant a rejection of excessive ornamentation, the use of asymmetrical design, an analytical approach to the function of buildings, and innovation.
